            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:170144:9"/>the diſcharge of the great Ordnance there ſerved for a warning to the Earles of <hi>Shrewsbury, Suſsex, Southamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and other Lords, to waite on the Duke of <hi>Yorke</hi> to the Staires of White-Hall for his reception at his landing there, and to conduct him to the preſence of the King, Queene, Prince, and Princeſſe, in the Banqueting Houſe; where having made an humble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to his Majeſty, and paſſed his firſt Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he addreſſed himſelfe to the Queene, kiſſed her hand, ſaluted the Prince, and turning to the Princeſſe (who was obſerved till then not to caſt the leaſt looke towards him) he ſtooped to touch the loweſt part of her Garment, when with her hand ſtaying his, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a kiſſe from her Highneſſe, and ſoon after they all retyred to the privy Lodgings.</p>
                  <p>The next day he ſpent in viſiting the King, Queene Prince, and Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and twice the Princeſſe, once in the afternoone (at her owne Lodging) in State, and once after Supper with leſſe ceremony.</p>

                  <p>The thirteenth of <hi>February</hi> following I was ſent by the Lord Chamberlaine (Earle of Suffolke) from his Majeſty to the Arch-Dukes Ambaſſador, Monſiuer de Boiſcot, with this formall invitation to the Marriage of the Princeſſe.</p>
                  <p>That his Majeſty (who deſireth to perform all things with conveniency) having invited the French Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador, and the Venetian, to aſſiſt at the firſt dayes ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, requeſted him to honour the ſecond, or third
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170144:9"/>dayes, either Dinner or Supper, or both, with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
                  <p>After ſome time of pauſe, his firſt queſtion was, (with a troubled countenance) whether the Spaniſh Ambaſſador were invited? I anſwered (anſwerable to my Inſtructions in caſe of ſuch demand) that hee was ſick, and could not be there; he was yeſterday (quoth he) ſo well, as that the offer might have very well been made him, and perhaps accepted.</p>
                  <p>To this I replyed, That his Majeſtie having obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the French and Venetian Ambaſſadors hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between them one courſe of correſpondence, and the Spaniſh and Arch-Dukes another, their Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had been uſually joynt.</p>
                  <p>This he denyed, (ſaying) The French had been fun dry times invited to Maſques, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian, the Venetian and not the French, the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard the like; but He, the Arch-Dukes Ambaſſador never: That for his owne particular perſon (as hee was <hi>Boiſcot</hi>) he ſhould think himſelfe honoured to be called by his Majeſty upon any termes, were it to ſerve up a Diſh to the Princeſſes Table; but, as he was the Repreſentant of ſo great a Prince, as the Arch-Dukes (one who would never allow (he ſayd) ſo much as a queſtion or thought of Competition betweene him, a Monarchall Soveraigne, and a meane Republique, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by a ſort of Burghers, who had but an handfull of Territory in compariſon of his Maſter; and (as would be averred, he ſayd, by ancient proofes, had ever yeilded precedence to the Arch-Dukes Predeceſſors, when they were but Dukes of <hi>Burgundie</hi>) hee could not be preſent at that Solemnity. That further, hee knew not wherein he had deſerved ſo ill of his Majeſty, as not to have received from him any countenance or favour in all the time of his reſiding here, and the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian (as he himſelfe had bragged) many; that for theſe, and the like conſiderations, he would never be received to a ſecond place, or day, after one that ſhould have the firſt beſtowed on him ſo unworthily. In concluſion he deſired, That though this was, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:170144:10"/>ſhould be his peremptory anſwer, I would from him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt the Lord Chamberlaine, that that might be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him for conſideration; and that the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he would by his owne Servant ſend his more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect reſolution, which he accordingly did in writing (ſeene to few more then to his Majeſty and the Lord Chamberlaine) to the former purpoſe, thus,</p>
                  <p>That he had ever yet had the honour to have been invited by his Majeſty; that the Invitation hee now had, was in a ſecond place to one who was farr from all colour of reaſon to precede him; that his Majeſty had herein expreſſed his affection; that he was ſorry he could not be there, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This written ſignification (redemanded and taken back after it was read by his Servant) having beene made the Saturday; the Sundayes and Mundayes fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting jollity and gallantry ſtilld all further noyſe of it, till on Tueſday I was commanded to carry him a written Declaration in French, as followeth.</p>

                  <p>HIs Majeſty perceiving that the Ambaſſador of the moſt ſerene Arch-Duke hath taken ſome excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that he was not invited to the ſolemnities of <hi>Madam,</hi> his Majeſties ſole Daughter, and of the moſt Illuſtrious Prince the <hi>Elector Palatine</hi> on Sunday the day of the Nuptialls, whereas the Ambaſſador of the moſt ſerene Republicke of <hi>Venice</hi> was invited thereunto that day; he hath thought good that the ſaid Lord Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador, and the Princes whom he ſerves ſhould under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that his Majeſty never intended to do any thing in prejudice to the pretences of either Prince or State in all procedures ſince his acceſſe to this Crown; but alwayes declind to comport himſelfe as judge of their competitions in this caſe, leaving them both entire in what appertaines to them, and treating them in a free generall way as his freinds. Now, touching the preſent buſineſſe reflecting upon the Ambaſſador of <hi>Venice,</hi> his Majeſty lets the ſaid Ambaſſador of the Arch-Dukes to underſtand, that the ſaid Ambaſſador of <hi>Venice,</hi> having fourteen or fifteen dayes before the Wedding day in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed his Majeſty that he had order from the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke to congratulate the ſaid Nuptialls, he deſired that he might perform the ſaid office the very day of the ſolemnity, and that he might do it with a better grace, as alſo for a more open manifeſtation of the hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our which the ſaid Republicke doth beare unto his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, he was appointed Extraordinary allowance for the pomp, and to put his men in liveryes accordingly upon the publicke charge (an honour which his Majeſty had not received of any Prince, it being Extraordinary, and not uſuall among Princes) Therefore his Majeſty had all reaſon to correſpond with the ſaid Republicke in like civilities for ſo ſignall demonſtrations of reſpect: Add hereunto, that the Spaniſh Ambaſſador not finding himſelfe in caſe to aſſiſt, and be preſent the firſt day of the Nuptialls, and his Majeſty being incertain whether
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170144:12"/>he would be at any other day of the Solemnities, his Majeſty according to former cuſtome commanded that the ſaid Ambaſſador of <hi>Venice</hi> ſhould be joynd with him of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſtyes, who had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited for the ſame day, according to the courſe that was allwayes obſerved, to couple upon ſuch ſolenmities the Ambaſſadors of France and <hi>Venice,</hi> as alſo thoſe of Spaine and the Arch-Dukes. And whereas it is preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that whereas the Ambaſſador of the ſaid Arch-Dukes being invited upon Shrove-Tueſday, the laſt day of the ſolemnity, one might inferr that a greater ſhew of honour was made thereby to the Republicke then to the Arch-Dukes, his Majeſty ſayeth, that he having allwayes been moſt curious to avoid all ſorts of offences among his friendes in matters of this kind, the ſaid Ambaſſador, if he pleaſe to conſider of it well, will find that this doth not carry with it any prejudice at all to his Maſter; in regard that the ſolemnity of the mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age being but one continued Act though performd divers daies, admitted neither <hi>prius</hi> nor <hi>poſterius</hi> in it ſelfe, but it is to be underſtood that each day had the like dignity; Nay, if one would Argumentize there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, it might be alledged that the laſt day ſhould be taken for the greateſt day, as it is underſlood in many other Coſes, and particularly upon the Feſtivalls of Chriſtmas wherein the Twelfe day or the Feſtivall of the three Kings which is the laſt is taken for the greateſt day; And in many places Tueſeday is taken for the chiefeſt day of Shrove-tide; wherefore the Mask at Court compos'd of Noble men and Ladies was aſſign'd for that day as being the greateſt of the Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valls; but his Majeſty, who doth not undertake to be Iudge of differences ariſing in this nature twixt the Miniſters of Princes, doth not ſpeake this as to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine any thing on either ſide, but onely to ſhew the reaſons which he hath on his behalfe in this particular, wherein he thinks not to have done any body wrong.</p>
                  <p>This being read by the Ambaſſador I demanded his anſwer, which he ſaid he could little inlarge beyond
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170144:12"/>the former; And then telling him, I was by command to returne the paper (ſuiteable to his owne, and his Servants proceeding with his Majeſty, when he laſt ſent his mind in writing) he affirmed peremptorily that he neither asked, nor had any paper back againe: And in this regard he muſt be pardoned, if he returned no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, ſince (quoth he) if I had received a meſſage by word, I had anſwered by word, If by writeing by write<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, But taking this meſſage for neither, I may, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, be ſilent. Wherewith when I had acquainted the Lord <hi>Chamberlaine,</hi> his Lordſhip was ſemewhat moved (as for his owne perſonall intereſt, and taking Sir <hi>William Button,</hi> (my Collegue aſſiſtant of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies) to witneſſe what he had ſaid, and done, his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip willed me to returne, and affirme to him the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary with confidence; But halfe the wordes which I had to ſay to this purpoſe when I came to him, were ſcarce uttered when he confeſſed the Action, yet not without blaming his Servants miſtaking, and forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe to deliver back to him the paper.</p>
                  <p>At this time the French, and Venetian Ambaſſadors invited to the Marriage, were not free from Puntillios. That made an offer to precede the Prince. This ſtood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, that they were not to ſit at the Table without Chaires (though the Prince The King not preſent) had but a ſtoole (the Count Palatine, and the Princeſs, onely for the honour of the day, having Chayres) and inſiſting upon a formality that the Carver was not to ſtand above him, but neither of theſe prevailed in their reaſonleſſe pretences; Neither was the Wife of the French Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador cleere of theſe diſputes, for when I had uſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her up amcungſt the Counteſſes, and left her there to the raniging of the Lord <hi>Chamberlaine,</hi> he ordered ſhee ſhould be placed at the Table next beneath the Counteſſes, and above the Baroneſſes; But the Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteſſe of Effingham ſtanding to her womans right, and poſſeſt allready of her proper place (as ſhe called it) would not moove lower, ſo held the hand of the Ambaſſatrice, till after dinner the Ambaſſador her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band informed of the difference, and oppoſition, tooke
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170144:13"/>it for an indignity, and calling for his Wives Coach, that by her departure it might be ſeen he was ſenſible, ſhe was by others perſwaſions ſtayed, and was at ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per placed beneath the Counteſſe of <hi>Killdare,</hi> and above the Viſcounteſſe of <hi>Haddington,</hi> who made no ſcruple of it, the Lady of <hi>Effingham</hi> in the interim forbearing (with rather too much then too little Stommach) both her ſupper and the Company.</p>
                  <p>The Ambaſſador of the united Provinces (Sir <hi>Noel Caron</hi>) kept himſelfe all this while quiet without queſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of <hi>Prius</hi> or <hi>Poſterius,</hi> or thruſting for publique Note, being a continually entertained gueſt during the ſolemnitie of the Marriage; the carriage whereof on the day of it was this.

That his Majeſty was perſwaded, and with all deſirous, that his Excellencie would not paſſe any Miſ-conſtruction upon his proceeding, if the Spaniſh Ambaſſador newly come into this Kingdome, and who had not yet been preſent here at any enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments of Court) were togeather with the Arch-Dukes Ambaſſador invited to the Marriage of the Earle of Summerſet,
<note place="margin">Don diego Sarmiento de Acun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</note> and not he (the Ambaſſador of Venice) that if he would be pleaſed to honour with his preſence the Maske of Gentlemen of the Inns of Court to be performed on Twelfe night (a time amongſt us of the ſolemneſt obſervance) he ſhould be moſt wellcome to it, and in the meane time I was further to let him know, that there was an intention he ſhould be invited to the Marriage of the Lady <hi>Jane Dromond</hi> (firſt Lady of the Queenes Bedd-Chamber) at Candlemas. To this, his Anſwere was a queſtion, whether the King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Solemnitie towards for publicke, or for private? This I anſwered I had no Commiſſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve as from the mouth of his Majeſty, and muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore anſwere him with ſilence; But if he asked my
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170144:14"/>opinion as his friend, and Servant, I held it for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and in no ſort publique, ſince I took it to be an honour his Majeſty was pleaſed to caſt upon one of his moſt favoured Servants to have the Marriage Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in his owne Houſe, and to invite to it whom he ſhould think fit at his Princely pleaſure. This anſwer ſeemed to give him ſuch ſatisfaction, as (he ſaid), he was of the ſame opinion, and added, that ſince his Majeſty had vouchſafed the laſt yeare to do him the honour and right to preferr him before another (unjuſtly preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding) in his invitation to ſo publique a ſolemnity, as was the Marriage of his onely daughter, he ſhould bemoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civill now to except againſt his pleaſure in matter of ſo private a condition; but ought rather to returne him (as he now did) moſt humble thankes for the moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious regard he diſcovered to have of him, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of the State whereof he was a Repreſentant.</p>
                  <p>The next Morning I was ſent to the French Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors, who (though he might ſeeme the day before to hold one way with the Venetian, and had correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with him to that purpoſe, (whether another and he did <hi>ſ'entre entendre,</hi> becomes me no more to judge, then to declare) appeared now to have taken another way by himſelfe, and I delivered to him a formall invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Marriage, which (having firſt asked me whether the Spaniſh Ambaſſador were yet invited, and I anſwered I thought no) he humbly beſeecht his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to pardon him, if he excuſed his appearance at the Marriage, in regard that that night (he ſaid) he had the deſluxion of a Rhume into his Teeth and a fit of a Ague whereof he doubted the returne. I was ſcarcely back at Court with his anſwere, when I was told that a Gentleman from the Venetian Ambaſſador had been to ſeeke me there, and at my houſe, where at the laſt having found me, he ſaid that his Lord deſired me that if ever I would do him favour, I would take the paines to come to him preſently; I winding the cauſe to be ſome new buz gotten into his Braine from ſome Intelligence he had had from the French of that Mornings proceeding, excuſed my ſo preſent repaire
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170144:15"/>with the neceſſity of my Commanded immediate At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance on my Lord <hi>Chamberlaine,</hi> which I did to gaine both time, and further Inſtructions from his Lordſhip, wherewith ſo ſoone, as I was ſufficiently arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I went to the Venetian, and in preſence of his Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, <hi>Muſcorus,</hi> (whom he deſired might be admitted to our Conference) he intreated me to repeate the wordes of my Invitation, and thoſe of his anſwer, which I yeelded to (after ſome diſcovery of my inſatisfaction to be ſo punctually preſſed, as if he had meant to trip me) and in concluſion had his approbation, that all ſo farr was both in mannage and report without Exception; but that which now (he added) troubled him, and made him ſo to trouble me, was a later procedure of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty who (as if the State he repreſented had either in affection, or demonſtration of forwardnes to do the King Service, been inferiour to any) had that Morning vouchſafed the French Ambaſſador and not him a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne Invitation.</p>
                  <p>To this (after I had according to my Inſtructions (in caſe I ſhould incounter ſuch formality) brought him to confeſſe, that the French Ambaſſador had indeed given him that intelligence) I replyed, that to be plain with him, I had no ſooner received the meſſage of his deſire to ſpeake with me, but conceiving it was to the purpoſe that I now found, I did repaire to my Lord <hi>Chamberlaine</hi> with my opinion, and for his Lordſhips further direction, which I ſaid, was this. That if the Ambaſſador of Venice ſhould except againſt any favour ſhewed the French beyond him, I ſhould let him know, it was not that his Majeſty intended a difference in diſtribution of honour for their more and leſſe Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall Invitation; but that if amidſt the confuſion uſually happening at ſuch Solemnities, there were any omiſſion, he deſired it might be interpreted as chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and not of deſigne, which the better to expreſſe I came (I tould him) even then from my Lord <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlaine,</hi> and ſo from his Majeſty with the ſame order to him, as I had done to the French, to invite him. When not yet ſatisfied with an errand ſo ingroſſe, he deſired
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:170144:15"/>me to deliver particularly, and in the ſame wordes the Invitation I had carryed to the French Ambaſſador, which when I had punctually performed, he returned this finall anſwer. That ſince I was there preſent a witneſſe of his Realitie, he would not, as the French Ambaſſador had done, excuſe his abſence with his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but was deſirous his Majeſty might know (after his humbleſt and Thankfulleſt acknowledgment for his favour in his Invitation) that he took the publick hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our he had received the laſt yeare for ſo ſubſtantiall a Teſtimony of his royall mind towards him (as in theſe private Solemnities for him to except againſt inviting this perſon or that, whom he ſaw his Majeſty was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clyned to make his gueſts at the Feaſt, without over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thronging it with the preſence of others) was to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to take from him that liberty and pleaſure, which (he (the Ambaſſador) would ſtrive, and had ever ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to obſerve with his beſt diligence, and obedience. With this anſwer I was parting, when he ſuddenly ſtayed me with the reading of another ſcruple <hi>(&amp; hinc illae lachrimae)</hi> and asked me whether the Arch-Dukes Ambaſſador were alſo invited, whereof, when I had ſaid (to keepe my ſelfe clear from Categoricall aſſevera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) when I knew not fully the King my Maſters plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure) that I could not directly reſolve him, he would needs perſwade me that I diffembled, and that no doubt, whatſoever I ſhould ſay, I had in charge to performe that ſervice of Invitation, firſt to him, and after in my returne to Court to the other; a perſwaſion, which as ſoone as I found it aimed at (what he was moſt jealous of) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedencie, I did not gaineſay it,
<note place="margin">1 Seig. Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veleone.</note> holding it ill man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to marr a beliefe of an Ambaſſadors making.</p>

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:170144:16"/>would oppoſe or queſtion it? To this I replyed, that howſoever his Majeſty took no ſuch notice of any that reſided here as Agents (and not Ambaſſadors) for their Maſters as that to invite, or not to invite them was eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fentiall; yet my Lord <hi>Chamberlaine</hi> having told me, there was a Table to be both ſerved, and ſit at in State, was all on the Queenes ſide, as on the Kings, and that if the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents would come to either of them, the firſt come might make his firſtchoyce, there was no doubt, but his Lordſhips provident care for their placeing at the Maske would keepe them out of diſtance, and danger of diſpute for precedence. So they both came, but the Savoyard get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſtart, and ſiding allwayes cloſe to the Spaniſh Ambaſſador was both at the ſupper and Maske the more conſpicuous, while the other kept himſelfe retyred as <hi>Sconoſiuto.</hi>

He accepted the Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with humble thankes as an eſpeciall favour (he ſaid) done to him by his Majeſty, but deſired (if his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire might be preſented to her Majeſty as that ſhe might not interpret it for a ſingularity in him, or a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to her pleaſure, which rather then to incurr he would (he ſaid) lay aſide all other reſpects, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his reaſon to her will) that he might be excuſed his comming to Dinner, and be preſent onely at Supper, and at the entertainment after it. When I had (as far as good manners would allow me) provoked him to the reaſon of his requeſt, (that I might at leaſt glance at it in returning his anſwer to the Lord <hi>Chamberlaine,</hi> to procure it the better paſſage) he would have made it appeare, that a part of his reaſon was that his Lent was already entered, and that to be at two meales of fleſh
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:170144:16"/>togeather would be too great a ſin; but when I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved that Objection, with aſſuring him that at our great Feaſts, Fiſh was an eſpeciall proviſion, he came neerer, telling me plainly, (but as to his Freind, (he ſaid) <hi>Sub Sigillo confeſſionis,</hi> who hee knew would carry it no further (that ſince the Spaniſh Ambaſſador had had the precedence of him in his invitation to the marriage of the Earle of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> he would not wrong the Maſter he repreſented to march in the ſecond place, as it would be taken, if he ſhould come to Dinner, (though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dayes had paſſed ſince the other) and that the Queen, and not the King gave this entertainment; but if he might be ſpared (he ſayd) from the Brides Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, at the like whereof, the other (the Spaniſh Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador) might be though to have done well to have ſpared his preſence, in regard neither the King nor Queene were there in perſon, (a point, that men (he ſaid) of his repreſentative quality were eſpecially to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard in all ſuch publique ſolemnities) he could not, nor would refuſe the honour of being there at Supper when both King and Queen would be (as he heard) preſent, yet he concluded, (that riterateing his requeſt, that I would not communicate the formality of theſe reaſons) rather then he would in the leaſt point diſtaſt her Majeſty, he would (poſt-poſing all other conſiderations) be there both Dinner and Supper. With this ſignification I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the Lord <hi>Lyſle</hi> (Lord <hi>Chamberlaine</hi> to the Queene) who communicated it to the Earle of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter Maſter of her Majeſties Horſe,

It hung yet in intention when the Ambaſſadors Secretary came to me from his Lord with a further exception, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Queene were pleaſed, that he ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent both Dinner and Supper, he would be bold to prefer this condition to her allowance, that he might not ſit upon a Stoole but in a Chaire in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as the Bride ſhould be ſeated. I anſwered, I thought that would be a matter of no great difficulty. But how (quoth I) if the Prince be there, and have
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170144:17"/>but a Stoole to ſit on: If my Lord Ambaſſador were ſure of that (replyed the Secretary) I preſume he would make no further queſtion, but in all beare his Highneſſe Company. To be reſolved of this, I went at his requeſt to my Lord <hi>Lyſle,</hi> my Lord <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Carew</hi> Vice-Chamberlaine, whom I found all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, and having aſſurance from them of the Prince his preſence with the Bride at Dinner, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting their Lordſhips (as the Secretary deſired me) that they would not trouble the Queene any further concerning the Ambaſſador till the Secretary had been with him, and returned with his finall Satisfaction, he repaired that Evening to my Lord <hi>Lyſle,</hi> and propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame demand of a Chayre, as he had done to me in the Afternoone; it was reſolved he ſhould have one with the Prince, and ſo ended that difference.</p>
                  <p>The next day he came, and the Bride (ſeated at the Tables end, which was placed croſſe at the upper end of the Hall) had the Prince at her left hand, as the better place neereſt the Wall, (his Highneſſe ſitting with his right hand uppermoſt) on her right the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors both in Chayres, and oppoſite to him, beneath the Prince in a little diſtance, ſate on a ſtoole a Duke of Saxonie, here at that time to viſite his Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>The Arch-Dukes Ambaſſador received from me an Invitation the ſame day that I delivered one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and accepted it, though he were then (in earneſt) ſick in his Bed of a cold he had taken) both for Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and Supper without Scruple or queſtion (I will not ſay, without intention not to be at either) but his cold increaſing that night with a Looſeneſſe, he wrote to me to come to him (as I did) the next Morning, and there deſired his abſence might be excuſed to her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.

                  <p>The 5. of <hi>January</hi> 1614. The Earl of Sommerſet (then Lord <hi>Chamberlain</hi>) notwithſtanding he underſtood how the yeare before the Spaniſh and Arch-Dukes Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors had been invited to the Marriage of him the Earle of Sommerſet, and not the French nor the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian (for the reaſons elſewhere appeareing) gave me directions to invite the Spaniſh and the Venetian (not uſually coupled <hi>(ut ſupra)</hi> to a Maske of Gentlemen ſet forth at the charge of his Majeſty, and to come at an houre, about ſix in the Evening to a Supper that ſhould be prepared for them in the Councel Chamber. They both (with one queſtion of what Ambaſſadors would be there, and my aſſurance, that I underſtood of none beſides themſelves (as indeed then I did not) accepted the Invitation, and came the next day at the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.) A little before Supper, the Spaniſh Ambaſſador taking me aſide, deſired me to deale freely with him, &amp; to tel him whether Sir <hi>Noell Caron,</hi> the States Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador were invited, and if invited, what place was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended him, whether in publique neere his Majeſty, or in private in ſome Corner of the Roome?

Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he requeſted me immediately to go to my Lord <hi>Chamberlain</hi> for clearing of this doubt, wherewith ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting his Lordſhip, and he his Majeſty, I returned with this aſſurance. That Sir <hi>Noell Caron</hi> was invited, and ſhould be placed within the Barres neare the King, as Ambaſſadors uſed to be.

That it was directly againſt his Inſtructions to concurr with him in any publique Act, as an Ambaſſador, and that therefore it would be better for him (as he intended with the favour of his Majeſty) to retire himſelfe betimes without noiſe, then to be forced (as he muſt) to diſcharge his duty by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique exception, and proteſtation againſt the preſence of him (Sir <hi>Noell Caron</hi>) to the diſturbance of ſo royall an Aſſembly, and whereupon I told him (as from my Lord <hi>Chamberlain</hi>) that his Lordſhip was informed his predeceſſor <hi>Don Alonſo de Velaſco</hi> had ſtood upon no ſuch Puntillio when Sir <hi>Noell Caron</hi> had at another time been invited, as now, and ſate as it was now determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned he ſhould; he ſaid, he was moſt aſſured there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had been ſuch a concurrence, ſo as returning from him with this anſwer, I fortuned to deliver it in the hearing of my Lord Treaſurer, and received from his Lordſhip an aſſurance that upon his knowledge, and in his ſight, his predeceſſor <hi>Don Alonſo de Velaſco</hi> had indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red without any exception the placing of the States Ambaſſador at the left hand of the King, while he <hi>(Don Alonſo)</hi> ſate on the right.

That his Majeſty having invited him to the Maske, with a mind to give him all content, was ſorry that this queſtion ſhould grow to diſturbe it. That his Majeſty went upon grounds of former preſidents of the like concurrence in the time of the Ambaſſadors predeceſſors, and that the had for witneſſes of it (beſides his owne memorie) the Queene, the Prince, and ſundry of the Lords, who affirmed they had ſeene it. That his Majeſty having heretofore intertained Sir <hi>Noell Caron</hi> in that manner, and now invited him as an Ambaſſador, he left it to his conſideration what injury he ſhould do to abate of his accuſtomed reſpects towards him. That whereas the Ambaſſador affirmed, it was formally his Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons not to concurr with him in any publique Act, his Majeſty wondred that his predeceſſor ſhould not have the like Inſtructions, or having had ſuch, ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, or neglect to ſtand upon it, that if he had any ſuch, his Majeſty requeſted him, that (reſerving other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which he in no ſort deſired that he ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, beſides that purpoſe) he might have a ſght of it for his fuller ſatisfaction. To this the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor replyed (with many acknowledgments of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour his Majeſty had done him <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) That firſt, the witneſſes his Majeſty had produced were ſo ſubſtantiall, as ſhould he with his owne eyes have ſeene the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he ſhould not have truſted them in oppoſition of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:170144:19"/>their Teſtimony; That if it ſhould be known to the King his Maſter that <hi>Don Alonſo</hi> had committed ſuch errour, it would be enough to make him looſe his head. That it was true, that in his generall inſtructions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the hand of the King his Maſter, it was not intended, but that upon his Arrivall in England finding in what condition of reſpect Sir <hi>Noell Caron</hi> was held here, he wrote particularly to the King for his pleaſure about his manner of carriage towards Sir <hi>Noell Caron,</hi> in caſe he ſhould be put to it upon any incounter of Negotiation, or otherwiſe, whereunto he had received by letter from his Majeſty his will, intimating, That in concurrence of ordinary civill reſpects, he ſhould uſe him with courteſy; but in no caſe admit concurrence with him in or to any publique Act, and that his Majeſty ſhould be an eye witneſſe of the letter at his pleaſure. The Venetian (who remaind in the meane time in the Councell Chamber) having been by the Spaniſh Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador before the Lords entrance, made acquainted with the difference like to grow, had affirmed to him, That he could himſelfe remember, that when <hi>Don Alonſo</hi> was invited (as he was now) by his Majeſty, he and Sir <hi>Noell Caron</hi> were ſeated in a compartment, or place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and that <hi>Don Alonſo</hi> did except againſt <hi>Carons</hi> ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the ſame place neare his Majeſty; he affirmed alſo, That howſoever it might now paſſe between the Spaniſh Ambaſſador and the States, he himſelfe would not permit that he ſhould ſit (<hi>allato,</hi> his own word) in even ranck with him; but all the Allegations of the Venetian were held to proceed rather from a ſpirit of diſturbance (forward, as his naturally was, to make ill buſineſſe) then that what he ſaid was ſimply truth.</p>
                  <p>In fine, the Lords returning with this Declaration of the Ambaſſadors to his Majeſty, came back ſoone after with his definite pleaſure thus. That ſince he could not accord this difference, which troubled him much for the reſpects he bare to the Spaniſh Ambaſſador, he had willed them to ſignifie to him, that he might take what courſe ſhould beſt pleaſe him; And that if he would not ſtay the Maske, he would take order, that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:170144:19"/>the States Ambaſſador ſhould likewiſe depart, to avoyd all further queſtion, about either of their pretences. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this the Ambaſſador himſelfe, and the Lords fell to termes of reconciling (if it could be poſſible) the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, the Lords offering, that the Spaniſh Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor ſhould ſit on the right hand of the King, and at the Spaniards right hand, the Venetian, and that at the left hand next the Queene and Prince ſhould ſit the States Ambaſſador, this he harkened (not yeelded) to, but with ſuch limitations, as were not fit for Sir <hi>Noell Caron</hi> to admit of, as that he ſhould either ſit a degree or ſtep lower (which the place would not afford) or with ſome diſtance behind the Queene, and that he ſhould not enter with the King, but ſome quarter of an houre after, and the like, but the concluſion was (nothing being agreed on) that they would informe the King of his reſolution of departure, and ſo left him: yet immediately after they returned the third time, and (after ſome reaſons to no prevaileing purpoſe) I told him againe, that the King deſired to ſee the next day his inſtructions, and ſo had ſent him the good night. The Lords being departed, I ſtayed behind (as was his Majeſties pleaſure, and charge given me) to tell him from his Majeſty for concluſion thus much. That he had not been driven to this ſtreight without his owne fault, becauſe if he had made queſtion in ſeaſon, and acquainted the King with the limitation of his inſtructions in that point, there might have been another courſe had for prevention: whereto he replyed, that he had found his Majeſty in all ſo gracious, as he could not but with all moſt humble thankfulneſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it, and that it might be held indeed a fault in him, that he had not before hand declared himſelfe to that purpoſe, but no man could foreſee all things. So (haveing merrily requeſted the Lords before, that ſince his Servants were not Ambaſſadors, and would not ſtrive for places, they might be allowed roome to ſee the Maske) he with one Gentleman, his Secretary, and a footeman (I attending him to his Coach) departed.</p>
                  <p>The King the next day at his dinner diſcourſing to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:170144:20"/>this purpoſe, brought forth amongſt other Arguments this one againſt the Spaniſh Ambaſſador, that the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, or proteſtation he had made, could not be any way made good by him, the King of Spaines Agent, in regard the Vaſſallage which the King his Maſter pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended of the States, was not properly his, but ſhould belong (if to any) to the Arch-Dukes, to whom he had made a ceſſion of thoſe Provinces, and had likewiſe (he ſaid) but a poore title to them, having at the time of the Treaty of Truce between them, agreed to treate with them, as with a free State, and given them ſince in ſeverall letters the title and ſtile they pretend to (and which all other Princes and States (he ſaid) give them) of <hi>Les Eſtats confederez de provinces vnies.</hi> This diſpute, and difference occurred in the time that the Truce between the King of Spaine, the Arch-Duke and the States yet laſted. The Venetian Ambaſſador as ſoone as the Spaniſh was departed, was conducted by me into the ſecond Roome from the privie Gallerie, and there attending till his Majeſty and the Qucene came, went along with them, and was ſeated on the left hand of the King, beneath the Queene, and the Prince on the right. At the ſame time the Agent of Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence (to whom was ſent by the Lord Chamberlaine to invite him,
<note place="margin">Il. Gaval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo Franciſ co Guaro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſi.</note> no other then an ordinary Meſſenger of the Chamber, as to a Miniſter inferiour to an Ambaſſador) ſupped alſo in the Councell Chamber, and followed the King to the Maske with the Venetian, but having been ordained his ſeate in one of the Galleries, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated me to moove the Lord Chamberlaine, that (as he underſtood the great Duke his Maſters Agent, and the Duke of Savoyes had been) he might be placed among the Lords,
<note place="margin">Earle of Suffolke.</note> which was aſſented to, and he was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced (by the Lord Chamberlaine, and the Lord Treaſurer there preſent) beneath the loweſt Baron the Lord Mordant, and above Sir <hi>Thomas Howard</hi> ſecond Son to the Lord Treaſurer.</p>

<note place="margin">Don Diego Sarmiento.</note> his Majeſty returned him an aſſurance of wellcome. He was placed for ſight of the proceſſion as it ſhould paſſe by, upon the Terras in the window there, about the middle of the Brick-wall that divides the firſt Court, and the Cloyſter Court, and thence had his proſpect upon his Majeſty and the Knights in their paſſage, who being returned to the Chappell, he repaired thither through the Guard Chamber, and had his place for ſight of divine Service and Offering, in the Kings Cloſet. After retyring to the Councell Chamber, he had his dinner provided at his Majeſties charge in the Lord Chamberlaines Lodgings therby, and conducted thence in the time of his Majeſties dinner to the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetting Houſe, he ſtood at his right hand, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining diſcourſe with him all the later part of his Majeſties dinner.</p>
                  <p>About the beginning of <hi>July</hi> arrived at London a Young Nobleman of Poland, Son to the great <hi>Zomoiski</hi> the famous Chancellour of that Kingdome, he deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded acceſſe to his Majeſty by a Germane (one <hi>Ryder</hi>)
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:170144:21"/>that then lived in England, who ſpeaking in hearing of Sir <hi>William Button</hi> Aſſiſtant of the Ceremonies, (as if the Maſter of the Ceremonies had been in great fault to have neglected to preſſe his deſire of preſenting his Service to the King) was reprooved by Sir <hi>William But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> for ſo raſhly condemning the Maſter of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies (then imployd into Kent to meete, and receive the new come French Ordinary Ambaſſador) asking him if <hi>Zomoiski</hi> were a Prince Soveraigne or an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ambaſſador, that he ſhould challenge that reſpect of a King, not to be ſeene at the pleaſure, and time of every ſtranger.

                  <p>Who that day the ſecond of <hi>July</hi> had it at Theobalds, ſetcht in the Morning from his Houſe at Charter-Houſe by the Lord Walden appointed with Sir <hi>Lewes Lewkner,</hi>

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170144:21"/>charge of his Majeſty, beſides two or three of his owne providing. Arriving at one of the clock, he was brought to reſt himſelfe in the Councell Chamber, and at two was called thence by the Maſter of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and conducted by the Lord <hi>Walden</hi> to his Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the Preſence Chamber, where the King ſtanding under the State, the Ambaſſador marcht towards him, his owne followers firſt, next the Kings Servants that had accompained him from London, next before him Sir <hi>Lewes Lewkner,</hi> and at his ſide the Lord <hi>Walden.</hi> The Ambaſſador obſerving as little reſpect at his approaches as had been till then ſeene, after ſome few wordes of Complement, he preſented his Letters, which while his Majeſty read, he in all that time nor before did ſo much as caſt his eye towards the Prince there preſent, till Sir <hi>Lewes Lewkner</hi> rounding my Lord <hi>Walden</hi> in the eare, his Lordſhip ſtept to him with an admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for his addreſſe to the Prince, which the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor tooke. But whether this admonition were well given, or well taken, or had been better deferred till the King had read his Letters (or beſt of all perhaps in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated immediately after he had performd his reſpects to the King) it may be a <hi>Quere.</hi> His Majeſty invited him once to cover at firſt, but the Ambaſſador excuſing, the King put on, and the other ſtill ſtood bare headed, till the King having read the Letter, his Majeſty put off againe, and falling to a diſcourſe with him of ſome length, he never after covered till he was out of the Chamber. He returned to London with Sir <hi>Lewes Lewkner,</hi> and his followers attendance onely, my Lord <hi>Walden</hi> leaving him at the Court gate, and remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that night (not perhaps without a <hi>Soleciſme</hi> in Ceremonie) at Theobalds.</p>
                  <p>A day or two before his Audience, a queſtion fell out between Mr. Secretary <hi>Winwood,</hi> and the Maſter of the Ceremonies, whether the French Ambaſſador mentioned were, or ought to be invited to dine at Court, (the Court being ſo far out of London) the day of his firſt Audience. Sir <hi>Lewes Lewkner</hi> ſaid, he
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170144:22"/>knew of no ſuch order; why then (quoth the Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie) who ſhould know it? but his Majeſty (he added) is ill ſerved, and ill inſtructed, and thoſe things now a dayes which ſhould be done, are not, and thoſe not done which ſhould be. The other replyed, he was none of his Majeſties Tutors, and for himſelfe, he was to receive his directions from the Lord Chamberlaine, and without them not to undertake any thing in his Office; but to anſwer (he ſaid) more directly, he knew not wherein he had done amiſſe; yes, when (ſaid Mr. Secretary) this French Ambaſſadors Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was met by you in Kent, when he ſhould not, and ſhould have had a dinner provided for him in Court the day of his firſt Audience,

                     <hi>Seignior Barbarigo</hi> (who about a moneth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore came to reſide here Ambaſſador in place of <hi>Seignior Foſcarini</hi> departed (his Majeſty being at that time abſent at Royſton) was conducted from Charter-houſe to White-Hall by the Lord <hi>Haye</hi> for his firſt Audience, attended by many Gentlemen of his Majeſties privy Chamber in two of the Kings Coaches, and ſeaven or eight of the Lords, beſides five or ſix others hyred by himſelfe. Being come to White-Hall, he had his conduction (together with his Predeceſſor) through the firſt Court up the great Staires by the Guard Chamber into the Councell Chamber, where my Lord <hi>Haye</hi> remaining with him (while the Maſter of the Ceremonies went to give an account that he was come) he was after brought to his Majeſty in the Preſence, no other Lord receiving him at the Preſence doore, the Earle of Somerſet (Lord Chamberlaine) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then in Priſon. His Predeceſſor preceding, and firſt ſpeaking, he delivered his Letters, and a breife
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170144:22"/>ſpeech with a voice audible over all the Roome. Whence reconducted by the ſame Lord, and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen mentioned, to his houſe, they there found (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond expectation) a long Table ready covered, and many white wax Lights, not yet (it not being foure of the Clock) lighted. When my Lord <hi>Haye,</hi> offering to parte but invited to ſtay at Supper (though unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably perhaps at ſo ſhort a warning for a perſon of his quality) after ſome importunity of the Ambaſſador) yeelded (but with excuſe (to indeare it might ſeeme) his invitation over ſuddaine, and familiar) that he muſt firſt returne to White-Hall to waite on his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, promiſing to returne ſpeedily (as he did) with ſuch Gentlemen of his Company, as would accompany him. The ſupper was ſumptuous, excellently ordered, and of five ſeverall Services. The gueſts at it were thus ranged. At the Tables end, my Lord <hi>Haye</hi> alone; at his right hand, the old Ambaſſador, and beneath him the new; at his left hand Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> then nominated Ambaſſador for Venice, and beneath him, Sir <hi>Henry Rich,</hi> the reſt in their places.</p>
                  <p>Within few weekes after the Ambaſſador <hi>Foſcarini</hi> departed, who after at Venice, (being a man free, &amp; full of fancy, of a ſtirring Spirit and undertaking) was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed to the State (of holding intelligence with the Spaniard) by three or foure conſpiring Villaines, for what ends, either of malice to him, or advantage to themſelves I know not, and condemned, and ſtrangled in Priſon; but not long after being found guiltleſs by his Accuſers Confeſſion, his Body was diſinterred, buryed with Solemnity, and his Family (that after the courſe of that ſevere State ſuffered) were reſtored to their ſuſpended charges in that Republique.</p>
                  <p>The fifth of <hi>November</hi> (the day of the Powder Treaſon) his Majeſty had invited the Arch-Dukes Ambaſſador Monſieur <hi>de Eoiſcot</hi> to dine with him. He was conducted into the privy Gallerie Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſomewhat before dinner, and thence to the Kings preſence. His Majeſty dined in the privy Chamber, where as ſoon as he was ſet, the Ambaſſador having
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170144:23"/>waſhed apart, ſate down alſo at the Boards end at the left hand of the King, &amp; riſing at the end of dinner, an inſtant before his Majeſty, he followed him back into the privy Lodgings. His Secretary, and other Servants (two onely left to attend him at the Table) had at the ſame time ten or twelve diſhes of meate ſerved them in the Chappell Chamber on the Kings ſide. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded after dinner Audience of the Prince, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Highneſſe had ſuch buſineſſe with the Queen his Mother, as his excuſe carryed, or that he thought the demand of the Ambaſſadors Audience unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and too familiar with ſo ſhort a warning, he had it not till the next day, when he came purpoſely for it at the houre of his Aſſignation.</p>
                  <p>The Venetian Ambaſſador <hi>Foſcarini</hi> being (after ſome five or ſix yeares time of his reſidence) to returne for Venice, a day or two before he had deſired for his departure his Majeſties preſent of Plate being brought to his Houſe, he addreſſed himſelfe to Sir <hi>Dudley Carle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> (then newly returned from his Ordinary Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage at Venice) with a complaint, that whereas his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary <hi>Muſcorus</hi> (with whom he had had a long, and harſh difference) had been preſented at his departure above halfe a yeare before with a chayne of Gold of an 100 <hi>l.</hi> value (being (he ſaid) more by 40 <hi>l.</hi> then any of this place had before received) he (an Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor) that had reſided here the time of a double Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage was unproportionably rewarded, adding, That if he knew how to carry it without diſcovery, he would at his owne charge make up the ordinary value, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent (as he affirmed) conſiſting of not above 600. ounces of gilt plate. To cleere the miſtaking deceit, or intention of this proceeding. I went for better ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the Ambaſſador and of Sir <hi>Dudly Carleton</hi> (who thought himſelfe in regard of his late imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment bound to ſtir in it) to Mr. <hi>Seymer,</hi> one of the Officers of the Jewell Houſe under Sir <hi>Henry Carewe</hi> Mr. of it, and was aſſured by him, that it was of the Kings own ordinance, and regulating; if the value of the Preſent prooved leſſe then accuſtomed, his Majeſty haveing
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170144:23"/>(he ſaid) been informed, that his liberality towards Ambaſſadors in the Preſents beſtowed on them at their parting, exceeded that of other Princes to his Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors, ſo as he was reſolved upon a defalcation. And whereas the French and Spaniſh Ordinaries were wont to have beſtowed on them each 4000. ounces of gilt Plate, his Majeſty had begun with the French Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor Monſieur de <hi>Buiſſeaux,</hi> and had ſent him but two thouſand ounces, the like courſe (he ſaid) he held not long after with Monſieur <hi>de Boiſcot,</hi> Ambaſſador for the Arch-Duke, whoſe predeceſſors having before had ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred ounces, he was aſſigned, and received but eight hundred. So anſwerably, the Venetian Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors having uſually received at their departures two thouſand ounces, this had ordered him (after the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the other) but a thouſand ounces; and for ſo much the ſaid Officer affirmed, he would juſtify the weight of his Preſent, which might in reaſon have kept him from murmur, in regard he was by that proportion honoured with the gift of 200. ounces more then was the Arch-Dukes Ambaſſador, who had ſtood with him in competition for precedence.</p>
                  <p>The King being deſirous, that the French, Venetian, and Savoyard Ambaſſadors ſhould all be invited to a Maske at Court prepared for New-years night, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception comming from the French, was a cauſe of defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their invitation till Twelfe night, when the Maske was to be re-acted. This French Ambaſſador having demanded Audience by the mediation of the Lord <hi>Haye,</hi> and not obtained it as he affected (haveing not taken the due courſe of acceſſe by the Chamberlain (the Earle of <hi>Pembrooke</hi>) or being perhaps forgotten) was offended that the Spaniſh Ambaſſador (who had demanded one before the Kings remoove to Royſton, but was referred to his conveniency at his returne thence) ſhould have (as he had) an Audience before him. With this conſideration, and not without his Majeſties ſence of ſuch formality, he was not invited till for the Twelfe night, when he with the other two men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned were received at eight of the Clock, the houre
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170144:24"/>aſſigned (no Supper being prepared for them, as at other times to avoid the trouble incident) and were conducted to the privy Gallery by the Lord Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine, and the Lord <hi>Danvers</hi> appointed (an honour more then had been formerly done to Ambaſſadors Ordinary) to accompany them, the Maſter of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies being alſo preſent.</p>
                  <p>They were all there placed at the Maske on the Kings right hand (not right out, but Byas forward) firſt and next to the King the French, next him the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and next him the Savoyard. At his Majeſties left hand ſate the Queene, and next her the Prince. The Maske being ended, they followed his Majeſty to a Banquet in the Preſence, and returned by the way they entered: the followers of the French were placed in a ſeate reſerved for them above over the Kings right hand; the others in one on the left. The Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Ambaſſadors Son,

This done, the Ambaſſador requeſted me to moove the Prince for the honour to kiſſe his hand. But it was objected, that the demand ſhould have been more ſeaſonably made, before the very inſtant of pretending to it. Whereto the Ambaſſador replyed, that he had no ſpare time for it between that of his Arrivall at Court and his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate repaire to his Majeſty, which excuſe admitted, he was immediately introduced to his Highneſſe in his owne Lodgings.</p>
                  <p>

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170144:25"/>Ladies had been preſent at a tilting. This Preſident brought, over-ruld his Majeſty (who ſeemed inclined otherwiſe) to invite the French, Venetian and Savoyard (never before at any tilting) and now not willingly called to this, becauſe of the troubles that thoſe pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Miniſters uſually brought by their Puntillios at ſuch incounters. Sir <hi>Lewes Lewkner</hi> was ſent the evening before to the French, and the Venetian, and I to that of Savoy. The next day at two of the Clock he received the two firſt, and I the latter at the ſtayre foote of the Tilt-yard Gallery, and conducted them to the Chamber next that of ordinary Audiences, where they all attending till his Majeſty and the Queen paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that way, they were taken along with them to the tilting.

                  <p>The King invited by the Earle of Exeter to hunt and dine at Wimbleton (as was alſo the French Ambaſſador) killed a brace of Staggs before he came to the houſe. There I demanded when it would be his Majeſties pleaſure to give acceſſe to the Ambaſſador whom he had not yet ſeen there? It was aſſigned him for after dinner. The Ambaſſador dined with the Lords and Ladies at a Table placed in the midſt of a faire Roome, he ſeated in a Chaire at the upper end, at his right hand the Earle of <hi>Arundell,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Mountgomery,</hi> the Lady <hi>Elizabeth Hatton,</hi> the Lady <hi>Reſſe &amp;c.</hi> At his left, the Lady of Exeter, the Lady <hi>Ann.

                  <p>Towards the time of Solemnity of Prince Charles his Creation for Prince of Wales, the King adviſed with ſome of his Lords which of the Ambaſſadors, French or Spaniſh, were firſt to be invited to it. The Spaniard had by a private and ſilent way offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to an Invitation. The French had been earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſſed for by ſome Lords his favourous neere about the King. And had he but two dayes before (when he had an Audience of his Majeſty) made offer of his preſence at the Feaſt, his Majeſty had perhaps been put to ſome plunge how to have excuſed it. But on Sunday night (the Eve of the Feaſt) a reſolution to invite neither was taken, and I ſent to the Spaniſh Ambaſſador with this Meſſage, that his Majeſty thankt him much for the offer he had made to honour the Prince his Creation with his preſence, that ſome of his Majeſties Servants neere him had earneſtly ſolicited him to invite the French Ambaſſador, but his deſire having been (as it ſhould be ever) to give content to all Miniſters of Forren Princes, he hoped and requeſted that he would not take it in ill part, if he ſhould not be at all invited (no more then the French Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor ſhould be) to that Solemnity, aſſuring him that to the next (whenſoever) he ſhould be invited before any. The Ambaſſador returned him for anſwer, that he moſt humbly kiſſed his Majeſties hands, and deſired, he would in all proceed with him as with an Engliſh man, and his Servant, that whenſoever it ſhould be his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to do him the honour to invite him, it ſhould be
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:170144:26"/>his happineſſe, and an eſpeciall contentment to him. So againe, when his Majeſty ſhould think fit he ſhould be abſent, it ſhould content him alſo, as being his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties pleaſure to have it ſo. At my parting he was earneſt to know whether there were not the like meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and excuſe ſent to the French Ambaſſador, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (though had it been ſo, it had been neither reaſon nor duty for me to diſcover) when I aſſured him there was none, he expreſſed much the greater Satisfact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion.</p>
                  <p>About this time <hi>Cavalvere Guarateſi</hi> Agent here for the Duke of Florence, being aſſigned an Audience of his Majeſty, was by miſtake brought in (by whom I know not) by the way of the Parke, and privy Gallerie, and had a fire made him in the Chamber of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors Ordinary Audience; Sir <hi>Lewes Lewkner</hi> at the ſame time told me of him, and wiſht me to go to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him; but neither was that Service to be performed by me to the Perſon of an Agent (and therefore by me declined) neither was any Agent to be admitted to that place by that way, but by the way of the privy Chamber.</p>

But his Majeſty and my Lord being (when my letters came) allready horſed to ride on hunting, all reſted without further order till the evening that we arrived at our Lodging, whence I went immediately to my Lord of <hi>Buckingham</hi> (my Lord Chamberlain being then at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don) with the accoumpt of our comming, and to ſolicite the Ambaſſadors Audience, but this being referred for reſolution to the next morning, I acquainted Mr. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary <hi>Lake,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Fenton</hi> with the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors deſire of diſpatch, and at eleaven of the Clock before noone obtained the Kings pleaſure for acceſſe at two After noone, when the Lord <hi>Clifford</hi> with halfe a dozen Gentlemen of the privy Chamber, his Majeſties Coach, and the Biſhop of Wincheſters went to receive him at his Lodging, and with the Ambaſſadors follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in other foure Coaches that brought us from Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, brought him to Court. He was conducted (without ſtay any where) to the Preſence Chamber, where his Majeſty was already come forth to receive him. Having delivered his letters of credence, he made an Oration (to the purpoſe of the Kings Princely Office of media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Peace between the King of Denmark, and Sweden) of almoſt an houre long. Which finiſhed, and breifely anſwered by his Majeſty in the ſame Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, the Ambaſſador turned to the Prince, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to him another formall ſpeech, the King left him, ſo did the Ambaſſadors (after a while) the Prince, and returned to his Lodgings.</p>
                  <p>This was on Thurſday; The Saturday following about ten of the clock at night, came to my Lodging one of the Pages of the Bedd-Chamber to tell me from his Majeſty, that his pleaſure was I ſhould invite the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:170144:29"/>Ambaſſador to dine with him the next day; which I performed in the morning, and had his Majeſties Coach (no more) attending at the Court gate, about Noone when the King having ordered, that a Noble man ſhould fetch him from his Lodging, it was held by others needleſſe, and except at his firſt Audience (now paſt) and at his laſt, I onely might ſerve the turne for his conduction, which was allowed of, and I with Sir <hi>James Spence</hi> onely, brought him through the Preſence into the withdrawing Chamber, where the King within a while entering, he took him with him to dinner in the Preſence Chamber. About the midſt of the Table (as accuſtomed) ſate the King; at his left hand the Prince, and at the Tables end beneath, the Ambaſſador) who had for his Carver none but the Princes, and for his cup one of his own Gentlemen. Before dinner a queſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion grew (which was diverſly argued according to opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) whether the Prince were to fit covered at dinner or no in Preſence of his Father, ſeeing the Ambaſſador, as a Kings repreſentant, was not to ſit uncovered? Some affirmed, they had ſeene the Prince ſit bare headed, when an Ambaſſador had his hat on: others otherwiſe. But the King cleared all, when after I had given him an hint of the queſtion, and that himſelfe had ſate a while uncovered, he put on, and willed the like to be done by the Prince, and the Ambaſſador. The Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors Gentlemen had no Table appointed for them (by the Kings expreſſe order) becauſe (he ſaid) the young Prince of <hi>Anhaults</hi> Gentlemen (who had been with him the weeke before) had none, though the reaſon might not ſeem to ſerve for one as for the other (the different qualities of their Maſters conſidered) but were ſent two, or three of the cheife of them to the Table of the Groome of the Stoole, the Lord <hi>Fenton,</hi> the reſt dined after with the Princes Waiters. When dinner was done, the King retyred himſelfe, and left the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors there in the withdrawing Chamber to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend there his returne, which was an houre after, and then holding with him a private conference, his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants were after admitted into the roome, with whom I
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170144:30"/>entring, his Majeſty drew out my Sword and knighted with it the Ambaſſador. From thence the Ambaſſador went (by aſſignation from the Prince, who would ſave him (he ſaid) his offered paines of going to his Inn and returning) ſtreight to his Highneſſe Lodgings, and after a ſhort Audience, tooke his leave. His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty by the mediation of Sir <hi>James Spence,</hi> was pleaſed (beſides giving him a Patent for confirmation of his Knight-hood) to add a marke of honour to his Coate of Armes.</p>
                  <p>The next day we left <hi>New-Market,</hi> dined at Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, ſaw the beſt Colledges there, lay the firſt night at Newport neare Audley end (which rare Building of the Earle of Suffolks the Ambaſſador alſo ſaw) lodgd the next night at Waltham, and after ten dayes abſence were againe at London. There after the Ambaſſador had reſted a day or two, he demanded Audience of the Queene, but her Majeſty refuſed to give it without other reaſon or excuſe, then that the King his Maſter had not written to her, and why ſhould ſhe then (ſhe ſaid) ſee his Servant. Towards the day of his parting (the King being then returned to London) and he having already taken leave of his Majeſty at <hi>New-Market,</hi> it was held by ſome of the Lords, that his Majeſty neede ſend him no preſent, his buſineſſe (they ſaid) little concerning us here, and his Maſter a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Prince of little, or of no neceſſary correſpondence with us. Beſides, he was ſent hither with that Kings intereſt onely, as with a demand of aid againſt the King of Poland, and to ſolicite his Majeſties mediation for freindſhip between him, and the King of Denmarke, and ſinally to thank his Majeſty for the good, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall Office he had done the King, and State of Swethland in compoſing by his Ambaſſador the bloody differences between them, and the Ruſſians, with other the like reaſons too frugally (perhaps) alleadged for ſparing of a Preſent. But I intimating to my Lord Chamberlain, that ſeeing he had not been here defray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:170144:30"/>graced by his Majeſty had fairely carried the buſineſſe he came for, of expreſſing of thankefullneſſe, and was the firſt Ambaſſador that ever came from that King ſince his coming to the Crown of <hi>Swethen.</hi> His Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip moved his Majeſty in it, and ſo prevailed, as that he ſent him by me a Diamond Ring, and his picture incloſed in it worth about—2000 <hi>l.</hi> ſent to him (I ſaid) when I preſented it, as a private Toaken without publique Ceremonie to be worne by him, not for the value, but for the ſenders memory. A day or two after he departed without any attendance or convoy of Barges or Coaches to <hi>Graveſend,</hi> and there tooke Shi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping. I moved my Lord Chamberlain for the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors uſe of the Kings Barge to <hi>Graveſend,</hi> but his Lordſhip anſwered me, he knew of no ſuch cuſtome, and could therefore give no ſuch directions. But his Lordſhip was herein miſtaken, both for the extent of his owne power, and the Ambaſſadors right, the cuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ome having ever been for the Lord Chamberlain to command, and for Ambaſſadors (eſpecially extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries) to uſe his Majeſties Barges to, and from <hi>Graveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end,</hi> as at their coming, ſo at their parting.</p>

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170144:31"/>and that threfore both muſt be alike proceeded with.</p>
                  <p>So the next day I was ſent to them with the Kings Coach and the Marqueſſe of Buckinghams with the company of foure or five of the Kings Servants (an honour more then uſuall at ſuch invitations) but the Merchants had made it their requeſt, and it was not ſtood on for ſatisfaction of that particular Ambaſſador (whoſe Nation ſtands ſo much on Ceremony) with order to me to bring them to the Court gate by eleaven of the Clock, and this without ſtay through the Guard Chamber, and Preſence to the privy Chamber, where his Majeſty would be ſeated under the State, ready to receive them. And that after their Complement ſhould be paſſed, thence I was to conduct them along the privy Gallery to the Councell Chamber for their conference with the Lords about their Negotiation (while the King ſhould be at Chappell) and after to conduct them along the Terras, and by the way they had before paſſed to the privy Chamber to dinner. But all this deſigned courſe, was inverted by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties impatience to ſtay ſo long for them, when, by reaſon I had relyed on my Lord Marqueſſe of Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams aſſurance over night, that he would give order (as Maſter of the Horſe) for the Kings coach to be ready the next day at the appointed houre, and his Lordſhip had forgotten it) we could not come to Court (being ſo retarded) till after eleaven; ſo as the King being already gone to Chappell, I received a direction dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the former, and diſcending from the Coaches at the Court gate, then happened another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruity; the Lord <hi>de la ware</hi> appointed to receive them there, did not appeare at his time, ſo as the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors (Puntillios in their reception) made a ſtand under the Court gate, but at laſt (againſt their Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious ſtomacks) went on as far as the midſt of that firſt Court, where they were met by the ſaid Lord, and after on the top of the Stone ſtayres by <hi>Richard</hi> Earle of Dorſet, which two Lords conducted them over the Terras into the Councell Chamber, kept them compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with almoſt an hours patience, till his Majeſties
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:170144:31"/>return from Chappell, they were at laſt brought through the Stone-Table Chamber, where the Lord Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine met them, to the privy Gallery, where (about the midſt of it) ſtood the King and received them, and was thence followed by them into the Privie Chamber, where the two Ambaſſadors ſeared at the Tables end of his Majeſties left hand, they had their Health drunk to them by his Majeſtie after their Country manner, and the two Cups they drunk in, preſented to them; After this followed, their Emperors Health drunk to them by his Majeſtie</p>
                  <p>Their ſervants (about fifty of them) had a Dinner provided in the Guard Chamber, where the Guard that waited on them failed not of their accuſtomed care (by ſoone ſhifting away their Diſhes) to keep them from ſurfeiting. The Ambaſſadors after Dinner were recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by the two Lords mentioned, to their ſeverall Stations, and by me and ſome of the Kings Servants to their Lodgings. Their failing at the time of their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation (as before) was a cauſe, that the conference they ſhould then have had with the Councell, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred till the day following at nine of the Clock, which ſhould have been otherwiſe either immediatly before Dinner, or in the afternoon, if they had not alleadged for excuſe, that it was the Cuſtome of their Country, that whenſoever an Ambaſſador was to have an Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Prince his Councell, they were to ſee the Prince his Eyes firſt, but in regard that their feaſting with the King (where they ſaid) they hoped his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie would allow them the liberty to take their Drink, (which they muſt forbear if buſineſs were immediatly to follow) they deſired they might not have their Audience till the next morning, and then ſee his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Eyes before they ſhould ſee his Councellors.</p>
                  <p>This requeſt (though unuſuall) thought reaſonable and granted. I about nine in the morning fetcht them from their home, where the Chancellor took ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions that he had never a Gentleman ſent to ſit within his Coach, which was the Lord Chamberlaines (ſent ordinarily then with the Kings) as I did with his
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:170144:32"/>fellow Commiſſioner. And bringing them by direction through the Park, and the Tylt-yard Gallery to the Ordinary Chamber of attendance for Audiences, the King ſaw them only in the next Roome ſave one to the Privie Gallerie, and there with three words and their low reverences left them to the Councell.</p>
                  <p>Eight of which having gone before into the Councell Chamber, and comming back to meet and receive them in the Stone-Table Chamber, they were by them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced (the Ambaſſador preceding) their Buſineſs heard, they diſpatcht, brought back by the Councell to the Chamber where the King had ſeen them, and they (as they deſired) his Majeſties Eyes, and there left to my reconduction (which they had) to their Lodgings.</p>
                  <p>A Mask prepared for Twelftyde (wherein the Prince was to be a principall Actor) and that his firſt Exerciſe in that kinde) was a ſubject for the King to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite to it the Spaniſh Ambaſſador, and to obſerve the promiſe his Majeſtiy had made him the yeare before to that purpoſe, the rather becauſe a Marriage between the Prince and the <hi>Infanta</hi> was then in Treaty. The French Ambaſſador in the mean time being left with litle or no regard of ſatisfaction given, or ſought to be given him, either by private excuſe, or otherwiſe. At which neglect (as he underſtood it) he took ſuch ſhadow and offence, as repairing to Court, and deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding (as unſeaſonably perhaps as impatiently) Acceſs to his Majeſty, was entertained by one or two Lords of the Bed-Chamber (whom he that inſtant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered) with as ſatisfactory reaſons as they could frame for diverſion, but with little effect, though Sir <hi>Thomas Edmons</hi> (Comptroller of his Majeſties Houſe, who had been in France Ambaſſador) were (together with the Maſter of the Ceremonies, ſent to him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly after to the ſame purpoſe of modification; ſo as ſtanding firſt upon his Maſters right of Priority before any other Kings (particularly before that of Spaine) and affirming that he could prove by many Preſidents
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:170144:32"/>of our own, that if the Spaniſh Ambaſſador were ever heretofore preſent at any ſuch entertainment, or Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity at Court, it was by the French Ambaſſadors per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, when either he would not be there, or that he was ſent to by his Majeſty with intreaty to excuſe his abſence; He at laſt threatned to make proteſtation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the wrong done his Maſter in his Ambaſſadors perſon. But this threatning little it ſeems regarded by his Majeſtie (who was reſolved vpon his courſe for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of the Spaniſh) was a cauſe of the French Ambaſſadors ſending his Secretary Poſt into France with the Account of the Kings and his own proceeding, and of the Letters that came ſhortly after with his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation (before his three years Reſidence (wanting but a quarter) were expired; for which demanding an Audience the 16 of <hi>March,</hi> and having it granted (or the next day he after two hours attendance, had it of his Majeſty in the Privie Gallery, and within few dayes after departed the Kingdome. The ill underſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Majeſtie and this Ambaſſador was an occaſion that Maſter Secretary <hi>Lake</hi> ſent for me, and acquainted me with the trouble his Majeſtie had put himſelf to, to make apparent the little reaſon the French Ambaſſador had to except ſo againſt his proceeding, which to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, his pleaſure was (he ſaid) that Sir <hi>Lewes Lewkner</hi> Maſter of the Ceremonies, and Sir <hi>William Button,</hi> and I, Aſſiſtants ſhould ſearch our Notes, and preſidents to the purpoſe of the Queſtion. Whereabout I preſently imployed my ſelf, and ſent my Collection (anſwerable to the time of my Service, and of my experience) to Sir <hi>Thomas Lake</hi> then with the King at <hi>Newmarket,</hi> but all to little purpoſe for his Majeſties ſatisfaction beyond that he was reſolved on for the Spaniſh Ambaſſador.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>March,</hi> 1617. The Earle of Montgomery Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of his Majeſties Bedchamber, was pleaſed to intreat my Service and company with him to the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian Ambaſſador <hi>Seig. Contereni,</hi> his Lordſhip being ſent to him from the King with a Meſſage in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of Captaine <hi>Manwaring,</hi> which I delivered by
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:170144:33"/>interpretation from his Lordſhips mouth to this purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>His Majeſty underſtanding what preſent uſe the State of Venice had of men for their Service, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to ſhew his affection towards them, in giving them his leave to raiſe certain companies here for their War, had taken further notice, that ſince they were to have Land-men to be commanded by Sir <hi>Henry Peyton,</hi> and Ships from hence for their Convoy to Venice; he thought fit to Recommend for command, and conduct of thoſe Ships, Captain <hi>Manwaring,</hi> a Gentleman that he had made ſpeciall choice of, and held moſt fit for that Imployment; and though the Ambaſſadormight have heard, perhaps, that heretofore the ſaid Captain <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waring</hi> had followed the not approved courſe of a Pirate, it was in his unſettled yeares, and more deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate fortune, but that now his Majeſty knew him to be ſo reclaimed, as if he ſhould himſelfe have preſent uſe of ſuch a Commander, he would imploy him as ſoon as any other of his Subjects, and would take it for an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of that Common Weales reſpects to him, if they would upon his recommendation entertain him. For doing which, they ſhould find him more forward here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to further, and aſſiſt them in any the like occaſion, when he ſhould ſee that at his requeſt they had made uſe of ſo fit a Subject for their Service.</p>
                  <p>To this the Ambaſſador made anſwer, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique was much obliged to his Majeſty for his ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious notice, and furtherance of their Aſſignes, and in particular for recommending one to their Service, whom he himſelfe, and the World knew to be ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and whom he had already recommended to that State for imployment, but had as yet received no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, which dayly expecting, he muſt beg pardon if he did yet attend it without giving his reſolution. My Lord replyed, that the King had been informd, that the Ambaſſador had full Commiſſion, and power to imploy whom he ſhould be pleaſed, and that with that liberty he might (he thought) admit of the Captaine. The Ambaſſador diſclaimed, that he had any ſuch liberty, and ſaid, that on the contrary he had order from the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170144:33"/>State to ſend the Ships away without any other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander then ſuch as were to go along with them to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne them, in regard they had a Commiſſion with them not to offend or aſſaile any they ſhould incounter at Sea, but if they ſhould be aſſayled, then to defend themſelves as they might with the power that was to go along with them.</p>
                  <p>In concluſion, his Lordſhip fell to demand (that ſince Captain <hi>Manwaring</hi> could not have the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that his Majeſty thought to prefer him to) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Ambaſſador would not let him aſſure the King (as from the Ambaſſador himſelfe) and in name of the Republique, that if there ſhould be hereafter any other imployment, ſuiting with the condition of Captain <hi>Manwaring,</hi> that he ſhould have the offer of it before any man? the Ambaſſador aſſured his Lordſhip he might reſt upon that, both for the reſpect, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique (he knew) carryed to his Majeſties Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, and for the merit alſo of the Gentleman then Recommended, whom he had already (as he had ſaid) by his Letters preſented to the State for his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and forwardneſſe to do them ſervice.</p>
                  <p>The Ruſſian Ambaſſador having received an Aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation the two and twentieth of <hi>March,</hi> for the next dayes repaire to an Audience of the Councell; a requeſt was made by ſome of the Muſcovy Merchants (as ſuch that well underſtood their Puntillious humoursthat way) that the Ambaſſadors might have (pretending it to be the cuſtome of their Countrey, and an honour due to their Emperour) a ſight of his Majeſty before their conference with his Councell; which yeelded to, I had order to fetch them with one of the Kings Coaches, and the Lord Chamberlains (which was for their more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour every Audience ſent to them in Company of the Kings under title of his Majeſties Coach) taking with me one Gentleman of his Majeſties Servants to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany me, for avoidance of the like exceptions as had been formerly taken by the Chancellour. I brought them to the Court at two of the clock, and diſcended at the great gate there, before I entered, I deſired them
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170144:34"/>(as I had in charge) not to take it in ill part, if they found there never a Noble man to receive them, ſince it was (I ſaid) a Ceremony not performed towards an Ambaſſador of any Prince whatſoever, except onely at his firſt, and laſt Audience.</p>
                  <p>This could not hold them from murmuring, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing with diſcontented Countenances their ill Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions; yet onward they went following my guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance (as my Lord Chamberlain had given me directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) up the Stone Steps, through the Guard Chamber and Preſence to the privy Chamber, where after ſome little time of ſtay (neere the State, but not ſitting, nor having any Stooles for it offered them) the Lord Chamberlain came forth and brought them into the privy Gallery, where the King ſeated about a third part diſtant from the doore there, towards the Councell Chamber with his chaire back to the wall on the left hand, his Majeſty roſe up to them; at which they made their profound reverences, repeated in breife the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of their errand, had a gracious anſwer, and were diſmiſſed to reſt themſelves in the Stone-Table Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, till the Councell ſhould be aſſembled for them, who in a ſhort time after paſſing by them, and onely ſaluting them, one of the Clerkes of the Councell cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to me to bring them in, when comming forwards they made a ſuddaine ſtand, becauſe they ſaw none of the Lords to returne forth to me and introduce them, till at length that reſpect alſo was by three or foure of the principall Lords given them, and they being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the Chamber, and ſeated in two chayres placed at the upper end of the Table, propounded, and diſpatcht ſo much of their buſineſſe as the ripeneſſe of it would give leave, and departed by the way of the Audience Chamber through the Privy Garden, and the Cloyſter or Stone Walke there to their Coach, and were thence by me and the other Gentleman conducted to their Lodging.</p>
                  <p>The next day being the foure and twentieth of <hi>March,</hi> and the day of his Majeſties comming to the Crowne, I was ſent (with a Gentleman to accompany

At the time of theſe Ambaſſadors Iaſt appearance in the Councell Chamber, they had an aſſignation to be there againe the Wedneſday ſollowing, but other buſineſs then inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Lords beyond expectation, it was deferred for a ſevennight longer, when I fetcht, and brought them (attended as before) through the Park and Galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to the Chamber next that of ordinary Audiences, where they had not, nor affected a ſight of his Majeſty before their Audience of the Councell (as they had done before.) Thence I go to acquaint the Lords of their being preſent there, and retuning with Anſwer of their Lordſhips readineſs to receive them; They would not be perſwaded to move thence till ſome of the Lords ſhould (as at other times) come forth to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce them which at laſt they did, and brought them (giving them the hand of entrance into the Councell Chamber) whence (after they had obtained a promiſe of a faire end to their Negotiation,) the Lords reaccompanied them to the Chamber whete they firſt received them, and there left them to my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction.</p>
                  <p>The French Ambaſſadot Monſieur <hi>de Mareth</hi> (having been detained here by the indiſpoſition of his wife, or rather for fome other cauſe tending to his more faire looſe at his departing three weeks after he had taken
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:170144:35"/>leave of his Majeſty) demanded, and had another Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whereof he had a quick diſpatch, with no ill countenance from his Majeſtie, or ſhew of inſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from himſelf.</p>
                  <p>The Ruſſian Ambaſſadors having received Letters from their Emperor haſting their return, demanded Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of his Majeſtie, and had it the 13. of <hi>Aprill,</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to it by me (as before:) They expected, and deſired at the ſame time (as at other) when it was always refuſed or excuſed) to have a Nobleman to receive them at their comming to Court; but it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand incharged to me to put them from that hope, in regard no other Princes Ambaſſadorswhatſoever were allowed that honour at private Audiences, but only at the firſt, and laſt publike, and ſometimes when they were invited to dine with his Majeſty as they were.</p>
                  <p>The 24. of <hi>April</hi> following, when they ſhould have received an Aſſignation for their laſt Audience, and fiuall diſmiſſion, but the Signification of it having been incharged to no one particular of the Merchants, nor (as it out to have been) to the Maſter, or Aſſiſtant of the Ceremonies, it was forgotten or neglected till the very morning of the day aſſigned for it, whereof (when I, and one Gentleman with me, with only two Coaches, as formerly, came to fetch them)they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, as of a diſreſpect, being their laſt Audience, yet they ſet forth at halfe an hour paſt two, that they might be at the Court by three, their hour appointed preciſely, and by me obſerved as punctually, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they might ſtay (againſt which they ever murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) for the King, nor the King (which had been moſt unfit) for them. At the Court Gate they were received by the Lord <hi>Gerrard,</hi> in the middle of the Court by the Lord <hi>Crumwell</hi> (an honour done them more, then (for ought I ever heard) to any other Ambaſſador, and yeilded to upon their own and the Merchants importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity) and on the top of the Stone-Stairs by the Earle of <hi>Ormond,</hi> who with the two other Lords conducting them through the Guard-Chamber (a different way from what had been before Ordered for their paſſage
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170144:35"/>over the Terras to the Banqueting Houſe, but ſuddenly changed, with regard to the then appearance of Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which in that larger Roome would have leſſened the Majeſty of that preſence.) They were received at the Preſence Chamber door by the Lord Chamberlain, and brought by him to his Majeſty there ſtanding un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the State, who when he had received their thanks, and was paſſing to his laſt Complement of farewell, they fell earneſtly to preſs his Majeſty that his Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador (then nominate for Muſcovy) might be ſent along in company with them, and with the money granted to be lent them (which was an hundred thouſand Marks.) But the King excuſing both, ſaying, he was not yet fully reſolved upon the choiſe of the perſon, for that charge, who muſt have time (he ſaid) to put himſelf to equipage. To this anſwer, they objected their Commiſſion and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, which they affirmed to have from their Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to this purpoſe; That in caſe they ſhould obtaine the ſending back with them of an Ambaſſador, they ſhould not come away without him; ſo as in concluſion, the King upon their much, and even unmannerly importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, denied them not that requeſt alſo, whereof they knew ſo well how to ſerve themſelves; as going thence immediatly to the Councell, (demanding permiſſion for it but at that very inſtant) they would not let go the hold they had gotten of the Kings aſſent, till they were diſmiſſed with the like from their Lordſhips, of ſending the Ambaſſador in their company, though this could not ſucceed without great charge and trouble to the Merchants in ſo long a ſtay, as muſt be neceſſary for the preparatives of the (till then but privately nominated) Ambaſſador Sir <hi>Dudley Diggs:</hi> This concluded, they left the Lords, were reconducted by the three Lords before mentioned to the place of their firſt reception, and by me to their lodging.</p>
                  <p>When the next moneth began, his Majeſties trouble, the Lords, and the Merchants ended with the diſpatch, and departure of theſe two Ceremonious Ambaſſadors, who (content neither with the Kings preſent then ſent them, and by me delivered, having been provided at
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170144:36"/>the Merchants charg (though preſented in his Majeſties name, and worth above ſix hundred pounds between them) nor with the Merchants worth well neere as much) murmured that they could have with them but a third part of 100000 Markes yeelded to be lent their Emperour, and for which notwithſtanding they knew not how to give one Marks worth of ſufficient Security, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They went within few dayes after (accompanied with Sir <hi>Dudley Digs</hi> his Majeſties Ambaſſador to the Emperour of Ruſſia) downe to <hi>Graveſend,</hi> and thence North-ward in ſuch Ships as the Merchants of the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy</hi> company had provided for their returne, and for the continuance of the re-eſtabliſhed Traffick of thoſe parts.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>September</hi> 1618. The Lords of the Councell had committed to a Juſtice of Peace his Houſe (in nature of cloſe Priſoner) one Monſieur <hi>de la Chenay</hi> (a French Gentleman, late one of the followers of Monſieur <hi>de Mareth,</hi> and now a domeſtique of Monſieur <hi>de Clere</hi> left Agent here after the departure of the Ambaſſador) for having confeſſed upon examination before the Lords, that he had an hand (by the ſaid Agents imployment) in an eſcape that Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> would have made into France for ſome diſſervice to his Majeſty. The Agent being hereupon ſent for, and appearing before the Lords aſſembled in the Councell Chamber, refuſed to anſwer unto Interrogations till he ſhould be proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with (as others) qualified as he was) had been, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging further, that Mr. <hi>Bercher</hi> (at the ſame time Agent for his Majeſty in France) had at an Audience before the Councell of State there pretended, and clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a right and honour done to his Repreſentative quality. <hi>viz.</hi> Not to propound his buſineſſe, till they the Lords Councellours ſhould ſtand up as he did, and be uncovered as he was in that place Ambaſſador (he ſaid) being allowed to ſit and be covered, as they the Councellors alſo were at the time of their Audiences. This <hi>le Clere</hi> affirmed had been yeelded to by the King his Maſters Councellors, and that he had reaſon to challeng the like from their Lordſhips. The Lords Anſwer was that ſeverall Countries
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:170144:36"/>had ſeverall formes, and that the manner of proceeding in France, was no rule for ours in England, where cuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ome had made it otherwiſe. But this anſwer would not ſerve to draw any from <hi>le Clere</hi> for ſatisfaction of their demands, till at length the Lords (neither to yeeld to him, nor to force his reſolution) thought good to retyre themſelves, and him with them into another Chamber, and there, as by way of private diſcourſe (where the place being no Councell Chamber, no odds of obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance were given, or taken) they examined him upon his followers <hi>la Chenays</hi> confeſſions and actions; he twice with great oathes denied all knowledge of them, till at length <hi>la Chenay</hi> (brought further to confront him) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging and confeſſing, (as he had done to the Lords before) the truth of his imployment for Sir <hi>Walter Rawleighs</hi> eſcape) <hi>le Clere</hi> could no further out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face it, but with ſhame confeſſed it. Whereof as ſoon as his Majeſty was informed, he was in his Majeſties name commanded by the Lords to ſurceaſe from all further negotiation or exerciſe of his charge, and not to come in preſence of his Majeſty till a meſſenger ſent inſtantly poſt to France ſhould returne with ſignification of that Kings pleaſure for the avowing, or diſſavowing of his Miniſters actions. About a moneth after a letter came in anſwer with particular charge (as the Agent pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) that he was to deliver it himſelfe to the Kings own hand. To which purpoſe, poſting to Royſton (where his Majeſty then was) and making offer himſelfe to preſent his Letter, he could not be admitted, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing referred for delivery of it, to one of the Lords that then attended his Majeſty, he refuſed it and ſaid, he would perſonally (as he had command) or not at all performe that Service. So as returning to London, and thence in few dayes to France with the ſame Letters undelivered, and the account of his proceeding, the Revocation of his Majeſties Agent followed <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

The Spaniard profeſſed to be pleaſed with his allotment, but the French not ſo, alleadging (though he had at the firſt ſeemed content with the diſtribution) that the Spaniards aſſigned place was in publique, and in the Kinge eye, his not, but in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate corner out of the view of the King, and almoſt of the people, though in ſcituation higher then the other, and in the ſame body of the Kings Houſe; but that which he moſt urged, and ſtood upon was, that ſuppoſe there ſhould be in their rancking there no difference, and that they ſhould be both placed, and entertained on equall termes, yet even that was a Subject for a maine exception in regard that the French King his Maſter would not (he ſaid) treate with the Spaniard as queſtioning onely parity,
<note place="margin">nec vult Gaeſarve priorem Pompeiuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve parem.</note> but as making no queſtion of his right of Priority, which he would challenge, and take as his due whereſoever.</p>
                  <p>Beſides (he ſaid) becauſe the Spaniard might ſeeme to haue the better place, as being moſt in the Kings and peoples ſight, and that place allotted him more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred, and out of view, though within the Body of the Kings own Houſe, he deſired that (if the place were ſo
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170144:40"/>equall, as ſome Spaniſhly inclined pretended) he might have the firſt choyce, and it ſhould content him. In fine being left herein unſatisfied, he abſolutely refuſed to come at all, or to ſend his Lady, though her place were already aſſigned her in a Compartment provided, and kept for her neere his Majeſty within the Gallery, ſo as in concluſion, the Spaniard remained Maſter of the Field, where no Enemy appeared, taking his place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed over the Porters Lodge as mentioned.</p>
                  <p>In the meane time other Queſtions grew between other Ambaſſadors then alſo invited; as between the King of Bohemias Ambaſſador, the Ambaſſador of Venice <hi>Signior Landi,</hi> the Duke of Savoys Ambaſſador <hi>Seignior Gabellione,</hi> and the States Ambaſſador Sir <hi>Noell Caron,</hi> they all invited, made promiſe to be there, and to content themſelves with the places appointed them at the lower end of the Tilt-yard in the Houſe of the Lady <hi>Walſingham;</hi> but the Venetian underſtanding the day before that the King of Bohemias Ambaſſador was to accompany the Ambaſſador of the Princes of the Union in his way homewards as far as <hi>Graveſend,</hi> and ſuppoſing he could not poſſible returne in time to be preſent at the Titling, he ſent Sir <hi>Lewes Lewkner</hi> to my Lord Chamberlain to intimate;
<note place="margin">Crowned Heads or Kings Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſsadors.</note> That whereas the Ambaſſador of Venice had been ever accuſtomed to be treated <hi>al pare</hi> with the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Teſte Coronate,</hi> if he ſhould be placed apart with onely the Duke of Savoys and States Ambaſſadors at one end of the Tilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, and the Spaniſh Ambaſſador alone at the other,
<note place="margin">Axiome.</note> it would be a diminution of his quality (the firſt place of an inferiour degree, being ever held (he ſaid) worſe then the laſt of a Superiour) and that rancking being not regall (which was that he pretended) but ducall, as he muſt eſteem it, if he might not have the King of Bohemias Ambaſſador for companion. Upon this formality of the Venetian, the Maſter of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies repairing to the Bohemian Ambaſſador, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his aſſurance with promiſe, that he would returne in time from <hi>Graveſend,</hi> and be there in perſon, the Venetian and Savoyard <hi>Gabellione</hi> concluded likewiſe
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170144:41"/>with promiſe to each other to be there, and with them the States Ambaſſador; but this laſt the Evening before obtruded a new exception, and ſent word to my Lord Chamberlain, that he had an expreſs command from his Maſters the States (which it ſeemes he had not ſo well thought of or had forgotten till then) not to quit the Precedence to any but to Kings Ambaſſadors and to the Venetians, ſo as if the Sovoy Ambaſſador ſhould be there, he muſt be abſent, and ſo he was; but on the day of Tilting, the Ambaſſador of Bohemia, and the Venetian both appearing, the Savoyard came not, though he had that very morning by his promiſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured his Preſence together with the other two. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Venetian having already taken his place at the lower end of the Tilt-yard (as had alſo the Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian) grew to be much unſatisfied and ſuſpicious,
<note place="margin">This tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hand of the Venetian who gave it him without queſtion.</note> that the Savoyard might have cuningly inſinuated himſelfe into ſome place neerer the King, either with the French Ambaſſador (who perhaps (he ſaid) might repent himſelfe of the refuſall he had made, and accept of the place firſt appointed, or with the Spaniſh) though that, (in regard of their then not beſt Correſpondence) were much unlikely. In either of which Caſes, the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador of Savoy ſhould, to his ſcorne, get the Precedence, being ſo ſcated with the preceding Ambaſſadors, againſt which (if it were ſo) he muſt (he ſaid) proteſt by his immediate departure, but the Savoyard (as I have ſaid) not coming, nor intending it, (as after appeared) laid the fault of his default upon an inſtant opportunity (even then (he ſaid) offered to him by the French Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador) of writing by an expreſs of his that day to be diſpatched, though the true cauſe of his abſence were imagined to be, that he was not yet reſolved (as having no order for it) to quit the Precedence to the Bohemian as to a Kings Ambaſſador, in regard as he was Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador to the Prince Palatine he had diſputed it; ſo as he drove forth the day in feare and doubt, till I that night reſolved him (as I promiſed him I would) by a Letter from my Lord Chamberlains direction, that he had that day received no wrong at all by any cuning
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:170144:41"/>or indirect carriage of the Savoy Ambaſſador for any advantage taken by his placing.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Axiome</hi> before delivered by the Venetian Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador (that the firſt place of an inferiour degree,

                  <p>The French King comming ſo neer England as Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays, and being newly returned thence towards Paris, ſent hither for his Ambaſſador Extraordinary the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>de Cadenet</hi> one of the Mareſchalls of France, and brother to that Kings Favorite, the Duke <hi>de Luines.</hi> He with an Attendance of between fifty and ſixty perſons of title and mark, and of above three hundred others, had paſſed the ſeas to Dover, before any order for his Extraordinary reception was fully reſolved on at London, ſo as the Maſter of the Ceremonies being ſent thither ſcarcely in time to receive him; he paſſed his time there four or five dayes for the better ordering of his occaſions. After paſſing on towards London, the Earle of Arrundell, accompanied with the Lord of Hunſdon, and divers Gentlemen of his Majeſties Privy Chamber in about twenty Barges went from London the 28. of <hi>December,</hi> and that night viſited him in his Majeſties name at his Lodging in Graveſend, where the Ambaſſador not meeting his Lordſhip till he came to the Staire Head of his Chamber door, and at his parting, accompanning him no further (no more then
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170144:42"/>did the ordinary Ambaſſador the Count <hi>de Tillieurs</hi> who had been frownd upon by the Marqueſs for not meeting him ſooner then at Graveſend. The Earle of Arrundell was much diſpleaſed with it, as with a neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of his quality; ſo as the next day (in ſome part to right himſelf) he deſired the Maſter of the Ceremonies to go to the Ambaſſador, and tell him, that in regard his Trayne was great, and his Lodging little, he would not be troubleſome to him there, but would meet him in the Street, and thence accompanie him to his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barking; So he did, and on the way incountered ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe of exception, in that the Ordinary Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador did not ſo much as offer him the hand (my Lord pretending a kind of right to it,
<note place="margin">The moſt of Opinions are, That the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador Ordinary ſhould have of the place he took.</note> at the leaſt to have it offered him in the preſence of the Extraordinary, but of this Quaere.) Arriveing at Denmark Houſe (ordained for the Ambaſſadors Aboade) the Earle landing with him at the Garden Staires, and accompanying him not further then to the foot of the firſt Staire aſcending to the Privy Lodgings, took his leave, and (ſaying, there were Gentlemen there that ſhould ſhew him his Lodging) left him. This bred much diſcourſe, and was (with the other reſerved proceeding of both the Ambaſſadors at Graveſend) ſoone conveied to the knowledge of his Majeſty who (ſenſible more of the cauſe given by the Ambaſſadors then of the meaſure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned by the Earle of Arrundell) ſtormed much at it, till (Sir <hi>Thomas Edmonds</hi> Comptrouller of the Kings Houſe, being ſent the ſame night from his Majeſtie with ſome formalization to that purpoſe) The Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador was ſaid the next day to have made his excuſe to my Lord of Arrundell, that his indiſpoſition in his Journey, and at the time when he came to receive him, was a cauſe that he met him no ſooner, nor accompanied him no further; whereupon the difference was for that time accommodated. After one dayes reſt, the King ſent to the Ambaſſador for conduction to his already aſſigned Audience; the Lord Marqueſs of Buckingham, accompanied with the Earls of Dorſet and Warwick, four or five Barons, and about twenty Gentlemen in the Kings, and ſixty other Coaches (ſo many appointed,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:170144:42"/>but the number was ſoone increaſed to above one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred) he paſſed with his Traine from Denmarke Houſe to Weſtminſter, the King there meeting him by Barge from White-Hall, and ſtaying his Entrance in the higher Houſe of Parliament, where he gave him (and with him the Ordinary Ambaſſador) a gracious Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Beſides the higher Houſe of Parliament, the Court of Requeſts, and the Painted Chamber (the way of his paſſage) were all adorned with rich hangings of Tapiſtry. At the end of his Audience, intimating to the King, that the haſte of his return would make him bold to preſs his Majeſty for another ſpeedy Acceſs: His Majeſty told him, he ſhould (if he pleaſed) have it that Evening, which was performed after his returne to his Lodging by a private repaire to Court in Barge, accompanied only with my Lord of Buckingham, when he had the Kings Eare two hours together.</p>
                  <p>On Wedneſday following being the third of <hi>January</hi> he was invited to dine with the King at Weſtminſter, where his Majeſtie comming thither by water ſtayed for him (with much impatience) <hi>Et p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

The French Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the beſt quality, were conducted by the Duke of Lenox, and the reſt by my ſelf to the Court of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, where the greater number of them taking their places promiſcuouſly at the Table, and the Duke lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them (perhaps ſomewhat abruptly) before he had ſeen five or ſix of the principall, ſet down at the upper end. Theſe begun whiſperingly to murmure amongſt themſelves, as thoſe that might ſeeme neglected to be left ſo alone without ſome perſons of like quality to accompany them, and to invite them to their ſitting;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:170144:43"/>which I perceiving, began to perſwade them to what they came for, and had prevailed with the Marqueſs <hi>de Money,</hi> and one or two more of them, till my Lord Chancellor <hi>(Bacon)</hi> the Lord Treaſurer <hi>(Montague)</hi> and the Lord Privy Seale (Earle of Worceſter) entring the Roome, and paſſing by them to ſit downe (as they did) altogether at the right hand of the Table, without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving other countenance of reſpect, then putting off their Hats, or once inviting the French to ſit down with them, they took their Cloaks, and with ſhews of much diſcontent, departed the Roome to their Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; whether I and two other Scottiſh Gentlemen fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them faſt with our beſt perſwaſions for returne, but not able to prevaile, we left them. Halfe an hour after I went, (as I had Order) upon an invitation I had delivered the day before to the Ordinary French Ambaſſadors Houſe, for his Lady to come that After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone to a Dancing appointed at White-Hall; but ſhe in her womans haſte to be at thoſe Sports being gone thither before I came, I there found all the Gentlemen mentioned ſitting at Dinner, To whom I ſaying merrily, that I was ſorry they ſhould eate two Dinners in one day (one of their excuſes having been, that they had dined already) and neither of them in the Kings Houſe, one of them replied, That reſpecting (as they ought) the honour of the King their Maſter, and their own quality) they would make me their Judge, whether when they were left alone by the Duke of <hi>Lenox</hi> without any perſon of ſort to accompany them at their ſitting down to meate: and that three <hi>Meſsieurs de robe longue</hi> (as they with a French ſcorne, termed the three great Officers mentioned who had their Gowns on) came, and ſate themſelves down at the upper end of the Table without ſcarce ſo much as ſaluting them) they had not reaſon to leave (as they did) the Company. To which I briefly Anſwered, I was no Judge, nor <hi>Hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me de robe longue,</hi> neither were thoſe they termed ſo, of inferiour rank to the greateſt Lords of this Kingdome, ſo leaving them, and going down the Staires, I there met the two Marqueſſes of Buckingham and Hamilton,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:170144:43"/>coming to the purpoſe that I did, to conduct the Lady Ambaſſadrice, and Madam <hi>elle de St. Luc</hi> her Neece to the Ball, when giving theſe two Lords a touch of what had paſſed (leaſt the French might think perhaps they came purpoſely to them to excuſe their Trayctment which had been too great an honour for them) they paſſed with them ſome few Complements, and letting fall a word or two to the former purpoſe, the Lords (and I with them) returned to Court, and finding the Ambaſſadrice, and her Neece in my Lord of Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams Lodging, I waited on them there, and to the Ball, where the Counteſs of Buckinghams Mother pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing her next beneath her Daughter the Marqueſs,

                  <p>On Twelfeday following, the Ambaſſador and his cheife followers were brought to Court by the Earle of Warwick to be preſent at a Maske; he ſeated as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with the King, the better ſort of the other on a fourme behind the Lords (the Lord Treaſurer onely and the Marqueſſe of Hamilton ſitting at the upper end of it) and all the reſt in a Box, and in the beſt places of the Scaffolds on the right hand of his Majeſty.

The next Morning the Kings, and three other Barges being ſent down for his Tranſport to London, we all went thither ranged by Sir <hi>Lewes Lewkner</hi> (for avoydance of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion at our imbarking) the Ambaſſador and his cozen with eight Knights, and two Gentlemen in the Kings
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:170144:46"/>Barge; his chiefe Gentlemen, and Pages in the Lord Chamberlaines, and in the two other the reſt.</p>
                  <p>He was received at Tower-Wharrfe by the Earle of Warwick accompanied with the Lord <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and ſundry of his Majeſties Servants. And in the Kings, and ſeven or eight Coaches, was conducted to his Lodging in Crutchet Fryers, ordained for him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayed (as was alſo his diet) at a certaine rate agreed upon <hi>per diem</hi> without attendance of any of the Kings Servants. His landing at Graveſend, and his ſo ſpeedy repaire to London, was a cauſe that the Lord mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned met him no ſooner. The next day (being Sunday, and his Majeſty deſirous for three or four dayes to leave the Town) his Publike Audience was aſſigned, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him at White-Hall (with the Conduct of the Earle of Eſſex, and the like number of Gentlemen and Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches as before) where in the Preſence there he preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Letters with a long Elegant Oration in Latine to his Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>The Tueſday following he was accompanied to his Audience of the Prince at Saint <hi>Jameſes</hi> by the Lord <hi>Danvers,</hi> the Maſter of the Ceremonies, and my ſelfe with other Gentlemen. The 24. of <hi>March</hi> (the day of the Kings comming to the Crowne) having been invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a Tylting of the Prince and other Knights) he was fetcht thither in the Kings Coach by Sir <hi>Lewes Lewkner;</hi> but before he came, the French, Venetian, and Savoy Ambaſſadors were ſeated in their and his appointed ſtand, hung and covered with Tapiſtrie over the Gate or Porters Lodge entring into the Tiltyard, on the right hand of his Majeſtie. Theſe three other I was ſent for to conduct from where they all dined together at the French Ambaſſadors, Sir <hi>Edward Sackvill</hi> having been appointed to conduct the Venetian, but he was parted from home before Sir <hi>Edward</hi> came thither. The French Ambaſſador at his entrance into the Stand, caſting his Eyes about him, and asking which was the better place, that on the right hand as of Cuſtome, or the other on the left as of Reſpect, and neareſt to the King? The Venetian Ambaſſador (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardeſt
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:170144:46"/>with his Anſwer) ſaid, where ever the French Kings Ambaſſador ſits, there will be the beſt place. To which the French Ambaſſador making no reply,
<note place="margin">

                     </note> but ſitting down uppermoſt on the left hand from the Kings right, the other two ſate by him in their Order, till the Polonian comming they made him roome to take (as he did) the ſecond place. The Tylting ended (and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) they had all of them a Salutation given them by the King from the place where he ſate, ſo parted without further Ceremony, then with my recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</p>
                  <p>The ſix Commiſſioners of the States, and the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador Ordinary, Sir <hi>Noell Caron</hi> (with the Secretary of their Commiſſion) were conducted by Sir <hi>Edward Cceill</hi> to the Chamber next the Gate, at the lower end of the Tyltyard, and there with his company ſaw the Tylting. Theſe Commiſſioners, about the beginning of <hi>Aprill</hi> demanded a finall Audience, and diſpatch from his Majeſty, and had for Anſwer, that the Sunday following his Majeſty was pleaſed they ſhould dine with him, and then take their leaves; but ſoone after a diſinvitation was brought by the Lord <hi>Kelley</hi> with this excuſe. That his Majeſty having ſince received the news of the King of Spaines death, and intending that day (as the moſt fit) to aſſume his habite of mourning, ſuppoſing that this and Feaſting would not accord, ſo if they would be pleaſed to ſtay their Journey till the time of mourning ſhould be expired, which would be at Saint <hi>Georges</hi> Day about a fortnight after, they ſhould have a day aſſigned them for the honour of eating with his Majeſty. In the mean time their demanded Audience ſhould be given them on Sunday in the afternoon, which accepted of, and the other excuſed with the reaſon of their preſſing haſte to be at home, they came then to Court in his Majeſties Coach (perhaps too high for their qualification of Deputies, as by the place of their laſt Audience they might ſeeme to be taken for no more) introduced by the Earle of <hi>Kelley</hi> to his Majeſties preſence in the Chamber of private Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diences, there took their leaves, and received all ſixe of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:170144:47"/>them the Order of Knight-hood. Upon which grew a queſtion from ſome of the Kings Servants intereſſed concerning payment of their fees (accounting from each of them to receive forty foure pound ſixteen ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings) theſe being demanded by one Mr. <hi>Agher</hi> their Collectour and at the firſt not refuſed by them to be paid, the next day when they came to take their leaves of the Lord Chamberlain, a doubt being made of the dueneſſe of their payment, in regard they were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Miniſters, and a reſolution asked of his Lordſhip, he abſolutely affirmed to their Secretary there preſent that it was unfit they ſhould pay any Fees, and that if they were againe demanded, they ſhould uſe his name for their diſcharge of payment; yet (notwithſtanding this Signification from his Lordſhip) the Collector ceaſed not to ſolicite in the name of the Gentlemen Uſhers and others, proteſting againſt the Lord Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlains power to give away or withhold their rights, till finally at their departure (<hi>April</hi> 14.) they left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them this Order (upon the importunity of the Collector, and my interpoſition) that if his Majeſty ſhould be pleaſed himſelfe to ſay to the Lord Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, or to the Officer that challenged the Fees, that they ſhould not be paid, they had no reaſon to looſe the honour of his Majeſties free favour; but if otherwiſe his Majeſty ſhould ſay they ought to be paid, that the Ambaſſador Ordinary Sir <hi>Noell Caron</hi> ſhould ingage himſelfe, (as he did to me the ſame day by his promiſe) for their payment. I underſtood after from my Lord Chamberlain, that his Majeſty ſignified his pleaſure to him,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>From that time to the yeare</hi> 1635 <hi>none ſuch have paid.</hi>
                     </note> that thoſe Fees ſhould not be paid, as being not properly to be exacted from Miniſters of Forren Princes or ſuch as ſhould have any Ordinary relation to them. The Commiſſioners went hence the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>Aprill</hi> to their Shipping at <hi>Graveſend</hi> in one of his Majeſties Barges, and were followed the next day in an other by the Baron of <hi>Donow</hi> Ambaſſador for the King of Bohemia, he alſo having about the ſame time had his diſmiſſion, and that day mine and ſome other Gentlemens company to their imbarking before Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.

A day or two before, the Lord <hi>North</hi> had order from the Lord Chamberlain to accompany the Florentine, while it was queſtioned, what Perſon (of

                  <p>A Count Palatine, Coſin to the Polonian, and three or four Knights of <hi>Malta,</hi> and of Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> (of the Florentines Traine) dined in the Councell Chamber.

                  <p>Twelftide appearing, and a Maske being to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by the Prince and other Lords and Gentlemen, my Lord Chamberlaine gave me in charge to repaire to the Venetian Ambaſſador, Seigniour <hi>Girolenio Landi</hi> with this meſſage as from himſelf (with requeſt of his Secrecy) That whereas he had told him two or three dayes before that no Ambaſſador ſhould be invited to the Maske (as the King had ſignified to him his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) he perceived that the Spaniſh Ambaſſador (the Count of <hi>Gondemar)</hi> had under-hand preſſed his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to be invited, ſo as not to appear to have doubled with him in what he had told him, he bade me let his Excellency know, that if he would for forme ſake be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited and frame ſome excuſe for his not comming, he would himſelfe (as from his Majeſty) ſend him an invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. But if he would be really invited and come, his requeſt ſhould be, that he would make his way to it by the Marquis of Buckingham. When I had delivered this meſſage to the Ambaſſador in hearing of his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary (whom he called in) he made anſwer, That for excuſe of his not comming (though for forme invited) he would never give that advantage to the Spaniſh Ambaſſador to ſay of him, that one day he would be well, and annother ill for his ſatisfaction (as he knew ſome had been) as if he ſtood in awe of him; and for the other point of making his way by the Marquis of Buckingham, he would never do it, ſince he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes (he ſaid) made his acceſs to his Majeſties Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence by the right door of the Lord Chamberlain, and would now enter by no other.</p>
                  <p>But ſince he ſaw (he ſaid) what this tenderneſs meant, he deſired me to intreat his Lordſhip in his name, that he would be pleaſed to go directly to his Majeſty, and by way of remembrance (no otherwiſe)
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:170144:49"/>put him in mind from him, That the laſt year the French Ambaſſador Extraordinary Monſieur <hi>de Cadenet,</hi> and the Ordinary Monſieur <hi>de Tilliers</hi> were invited to the Prince his Maske at Chriſtmas, and the Spaniſh Ambaſſador to the ſame Maske repeated at Shrove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide, to which he could and might juſtly have taken Exceptions, that he was both times omitted, but that the King of Bohemiaes Ambaſſador, being not then (no more then he) invited, he was content to ſuffer with him; but that now (though he might in reaſon expect, that he ſhould be (as in his turne) invited a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, he would not be ſo punctuall, but would referre all to his Majeſties pleaſure, yet if any other Ambaſſador ſhould be invited he would expect the like honour, as a reſpect due to the Prince and State he repreſented, who in all publicke places had, and were to have entertaintment <hi>al par delle teſte Cornate</hi> equall with Crowned Kings. And as for the Spaniſh Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador (he ſaid) his preſence at the Maske ſhould notbe an Excluſion to him) with whom though he had no correſpondency of buſineſs nor viſits, he had yet of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation and civill reſpects, which had many times in incounters in the Streets, paſſed between them, and might and ſhould paſs on his part at the Mask, if he ſhould there meete him: This meſſage returned by me to the Lord Chamberlaine, and ſeconded at the ſame time by the Ambaſſadors Secretary, and my Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying it to the King, his Majeſty was pleaſed that he ſhould be (as he was the next day) invited, and was at the Maske entertained with the like reſpect as was the Spaniſh Ambaſſador. The States Ambaſſadors were not at the ſame time invited with reſpect to the incompatibility between them and the Spaniſh, and the Ruſſian then here might with as little reaſon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it, in regard he had queſtioned precedence of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kings Miniſters. The French Ambaſſador had an Invitation <hi>pro forma tantum,</hi> with a civill requeſt of his next comming to avoid queſtion, which it ſeemes, he tooke not with diſcontent, becauſe his Wife and Neece were there preſent invited.</p>

                  <p>In <hi>March</hi> 16. Sir <hi>William Ruſsell</hi> a cheife Merchant of the Muſcovy company, made requeſt in his own name and of the reſt of that Society, that I would ſometimes repaire to the Ruſſian Ambaſſador (a gallant Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the Emperours Alliance, and a great Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in his Wars by name <hi>Thomas Simonwitz)</hi> with a viſit, and Complement in his Majeſties name. I told him the Maſter of the Ceremonies was already imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his attendance, and that with the knowledge, and order of the Lord Chamberlain, or of the Lords of the Privy Councell, and I ſhould wrong him, and my ſelfe to undertake it. This made him (with other of thoſe Merchants) to intimate as much to the Councell (in the Lord Chamberlains abſence.) So I was by their Lordſhips appointed to attend that buſineſs, and had notice given me to that purpoſe both by Sir <hi>William Ruſſell,</hi> and Mr. Secretary <hi>Calvert,</hi> to whom objecting the Exceptions that might be juſtly taken by Sir <hi>Lewes Lewkner,</hi> if he were not made acquainted with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment caſt on me by the Lords in a Service wherein he was already entred, I had for my further Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction a meſſenger ſent to Sir <hi>Lewes</hi> by Mr. Secretary, who returned with an uncertain anſwer, no other, then that he would himſelfe come, and ſpeak with Mr. Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary about it, but coming not in five or ſix dayes after, and Sir <hi>William Ruſſell,</hi> and the other Merchants con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing to ſolicit my repaire to the Ambaſſador, he went himſelfe to Sir <hi>Lewes,</hi> and brought me his aſſurance of ſatisfaction, with acknowledgement of my civill procce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and with profeſſion of his willingnes, that I ſhould enter upon the imployment, which I did the next day. Going to the Ambaſſadors Lodging in St. <hi>Thomas Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> and ſignifying (as I had inſtruction from Mr. Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary) that the King had ſent me to him <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesſed to be ſpecially contented, and pleaſed, that whereas he had hitherto (he ſaid) had no other but Sir <hi>William Ruſsell</hi> a Merchant, and no Souldier, nor Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier to be his <hi>Preſtau</hi> as he termed him) ſignifying the like Officer, as the Maſter of the Ceremonies) he ſhould be henceforth honoured by the viſits of a Cavalier;
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170144:50"/>and a Courtier attending his Majeſty, with whom he might, and would be more free in communicating what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhould concern the Service of his great Lord, and Maſter the Emperour.</p>
                  <p>The Eve of the Kings day <hi>(March</hi> the foure and twentieth) I was ſent to him for my Lord Chamberlain as from the King, whoſe name (though his Majeſty had nothing of the knowledge nor trouble of it, I alwayes uſed in all or moſt of my meſſages, and addreſses to him, to let him underſtand that the next day I was to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him to the ſight of the Prince at his Tilting (with the Service of his Majeſties coach, and ſuch others as ſhould be needfull for his followers; (which coaches were to be provided at the Merchants charge, though with uſe of the Kings name) but before he accepted of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation (onely acknowledging the honour of it) he by way of caution, demanded if I knew what place he ſhould have, and how entertained, in regard (he ſaid) that if his Majeſty ſhould not receive him as an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador preceding both the French and Spaniſh, he would rather keep himſelfe abſent, then diſturbe the Solenmity by proteſting and ſtanding (as he muſt) for his Maſters right. I aſſured him the care for preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that quarrell was already taken by his Majeſty, and ſo it was indeed. For whereas the French and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian Ambaſſadors were alſo invited, the Spaniard the like, (but he had excuſed his abſence with his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait to Highgate to take the freſh aire, and merrily ſaying when he was invited, that he had rather keep away, then be preſent at thoſe Excerciſes of danger to the Prince his perſon, till he ſhould be Father of two or three Children by the King his Maſters Daughter.) thoſe Ambaſſadors were appointed their places with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out in the Tilt-yard in a Scaffold, or ſtanding erected of purpoſe, and hung with Tapiſtry on the right hand of the King neere the Gate, but the Muſcovite had his ordained in the ſame Gallery with his Majeſty (but on his left hand, and with a Traverſe drawn between them) till that after the Tilting, he was onely to ſee the Kings face, and ſo depart; all which he interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:170144:50"/>to be the greater honour, the other Ambaſſadors letting it paſs in the meane time without Exceptions, as regarding his remote correſpondence, and holding themſelves not prejudiced by his ſo placing.</p>
                  <p>The French and Venetians followers were ordained their ſtands under the Gallery Windowes at the right hand of the King; the Muſcovits at the entring of the Tilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard on that ſide, and the States at the neather end. All thoſe Stands (as before at other times) having been taken up by the Maſter of the Ceremonies, or the Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants order to be defrayed by his Majeſty. The States three Ambaſſadors Commiſſioners were ordained their places at the lower end of the Tilt-yard, as the yeare before, and this without any of their Exceptions taken at it. But the Venetian Ambaſſador ſomewhat punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all (in remembrance of his laſt years Treatment) and now expecting the like reſpects to be given him, as he underſtood were to be given to the French Ambaſſador (for Sir <hi>Lewes Lewkner,</hi> being appointed to conduct him, my ſelfe the Muſcovits, and Sir <hi>Robert Anſtroder</hi> the States Ambaſſador) he was (as it ſeemes he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it) not thought on to that purpoſe, ſo as ſending to me about it, and I acquainting my Lord Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain with his formality, his Lordſhip entreated (by me) Sir <hi>Edward Sackvill</hi> the Earle of Dorſets Brother) to accompany him, which he being the next day ready to have performed, the Solemnity was (in regard of the Kings indiſpoſition, and the fowleneſs of the weather) deferred till the Saturday following, and then the like upon the like occaſion till after <hi>Eaſter,</hi> and ſo longer, till at length it was not at all performed.</p>
                  <p>The third of <hi>Aprill</hi> I had Order from my Lord Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain, that (the Maſter of the Ceremonies being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to Dover with the Kings Coach and fourteen other at his Majeſties charge to bring up the Emperours Ambaſſador <hi>Suartzenberg,</hi> and that the ſaid Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor was in the <hi>interim</hi> landed at <hi>Graveſend)</hi> I ſhould take one of his Majeſties Barges, and haſten thither to receive him, and excuſe that croſſe incounter, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him know that the Marqueſſe of Hamilton was to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:170144:51"/>come downe to receive him that Evening. With which order I tooke Barge when the Tide was far ſpent, rowed downe till we met a flowing water, and a ſtrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary wind at Woollwich, ſo was forced to Land there and (finding no Horſes) to go on foot five miles to Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford) where taking Poſt to <hi>Graveſend,</hi> I found there Sir <hi>Lewes Lewkner</hi> returned from Canterbury, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered my meſſage from his Majeſty to the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor. That Evening my Lord Marqueſſe Hamilton (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the Lord <hi>Wentworth,</hi> Lord <hi>Bruſe;</hi> and about twenty Gentlemen) came to his Lodging, and was met by him in the Entry, almoſt at the ſtreet doore of the Inn, conducted by him to his Chamber (the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador after ſome little refuſall preceding though in his own Houſe) and after brought back by them to the Street doore. The next Morning my Lord Marqueſſe againe repaired to him (with the Company of the Lord Viſcount Doncaſter) then on his way Ambaſſador Extraordinary for France) and a while after the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador repayed their viſits at the Marqueſſe Inn, when the Tide ſerving, we all came to London in ten Barges. The Ambaſſador, the Marqueſſe, the two Engliſh Lords, three Dutch Lords, and the Maſter of the Ceremonies in the firſt Barge. Two Dutch Barons, my ſelfe, and foure or five Engliſh in the ſecond, and the reſt in the reſt, as they incountred. Landing at Denmarke-Houſe Garden-ſtaires, the Marqueſſe accompanied him to his Chamber there, and was by the Ambaſſador re-accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied to his Coach.</p>

                     <hi>Bruſe,</hi> two other Lords and about twenty Gentlemen liſted with divers Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntaries (in neere forty Coaches, beſides other hyred at the Kings charge to attend dayly) fetcht him from Denmarke-Houſe to his Audience in the Higher Houſe of Parliament, where he made his Oration in high Dutch, interpreted by Sir <hi>Robert Anſtroder</hi> (to whom it had been the day before imparted in writing) he was conducted by the Marqueſſe, and the reſt to the Prince
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:170144:51"/>at St. Jameſes (with whom he paſſed his Complement in Italian) whereto the Prince called me for interpreter, and thence returned with the ſame attendance to his Lodging at Denmarke-Houſe.</p>
                  <p>Having remained here about ſix dayes (defrayed by his Majeſty, and attended by his Officers, and Servants) the Venetian Ambaſſador <hi>Landi</hi> came to my Houſe, and acquainted me with ſome diſtaſts he had to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. That the firſt day, and almoſt houre of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors Ambaſſadors comming to Denmark-Houſe, he had ſent his Secretary to viſit him, and to congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late his Arrivall, who giving him the Title of <hi>Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,</hi> he had not correſponded, but returned him (the Ambaſſador) that of <hi>Signioria Illuſtriſſima,</hi> wherefore his requeſt to me was, that I would in ſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner let him know by way of diſcourſe (as if I had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred him ſomewhere by chance) that I had asked him, whether he had yet made his viſit to the Emperours Ambaſſador, and that he had anſwered me, he forbeare yet to viſit him in regard, that whereas the Republique had ever been accuſtomed to be treated <hi>al par delle Teſte Coronate,</hi> the Stile of <hi>Excellenza</hi> had not been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him, but that of <hi>Signioria Illuſtriſſima,</hi> which for his Princes reſpect, he muſt not let paſs without tendring <hi>il pare,</hi> the like of whatſoever title ſhould be given him. That (unleſſe it were of late the Kings of Spaines Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador) all Ambaſſadors reſiding here had given him. <hi>l'Excellenza;</hi> but that the Emperours Ambaſſador had not onely not given him his due in Title, but in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall honour alſo, having not rendred him the viſit of his Secretary by one of his Servants. The ſubſtance of theſe <hi>Doleances,</hi> I the next day imparted to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors Ambaſſador, and received for Anſwer, that he would never treate <hi>del pare</hi> with him (there being ſo great a difference between the Emperours his Maſters quality, and that of the Republick of Venice) that the King of Spaines Miniſter would (he knew) ſtand upon the ſame termes of difference. That if any other Kings Miniſter (for I had told him the French Kings ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Italian, gave him alwayes <hi>Excellenza</hi>) ſhould do
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:170144:52"/>otherwiſe, that ſhould be no rule for him to be gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by. That the Venetian Ambaſſadors Secretary had but once at the firſt given him <hi>Excellenza,</hi> and had for the reſt made uſe of the third Perſon <hi>(ella &amp;c.)</hi> That at his parting, it was true, that he (the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mbaſſador) had given him but <hi>Signuria Illuſtriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſima,</hi> but that if the Venetian Ambaſſador ſhould ſtyle him ſo he would returne him onely <hi>Signuria,</hi> to expreſs the difference that ought to be put between their two tepreſentative conditions. That if he had not repayed the vifit (ſent by the Venetians Secretary) by one of his Servants, it was becauſe that Secretary had ſaid to him, that his Lord would <hi>Quanto prima,</hi> viſite him, which if he had done (as he had promiſed) he would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter have firſt viſited him by his Servant, and then by himſelf. This was the ſubſtance, and even the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of his Anſwer, which when I had returned to the Venetian, he only ſaid, If hereafter he aske you any thing concerning my Reply, let him know (I pray) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe terms, I will never viſite him &amp;c. The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador of Venice then told me, that ſuch another Puntillio had pasſed between this ſame Ambaſſador and the French Kings, who having given him the firſt Welcome by his Secretary, even at his landing at So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſet-Houſe, and the third day after perſonally viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, he (the French) expected a returne of both (eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially of the later) to him before to any other Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, but that he (the Emperors) breaking the Law of Viſites (ever to be returned as they are made in time, perſon, and order) had viſited the Spaniſh before him. In which regard, when the Emperors Ambasſador had ſent to know, if his leaſure were that he might viſite him that afternoon? He returned a plain anſwer by the ſame Mesſenger, That the weather had been long foule, and he meant to make uſe of that faire day to take the freſh Aire abroad, which was light ſufficient for the others underſtanding, to let him ſee the French was ſenſible of what had been done, and would not receive a viſite after the Spaniſh Ambaſſadors having given the firſt cauſe (he ſaid) to be firſt ſerved in returne of that
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:170144:52"/>complement. But ſome were of Opinion, that the French Ambasſador had been too quick, and too plain in his proceeding, conſidering that the Emperors Ambaſſador both affirmed that the Spaniſh had firſt vifited him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally (wheras the French had by an haſty anticipation only performed it by his Servent) and that at another time, the ſame French Ambasſador had pasſed over a ſubject for the like punctuality without any ſcruple or queſtion, as when the Bohemian Ambasſador was here, and had firſt viſited the Spaniſh, he was for all that viſited by him the French. Tthat by the ſtile held in the Emperors Court, the precedence is given to the Spaniſh, and that he was therefore bound to obſerve it here; yet notwithſtanding all this, the French upon a ſecond offter of viſite from the Emperors Ambasſador excuſed his being at home, ſo as there pasſed no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of viſite at all between them. In the mean time the Venetian Ambasſador after I had returned as from my ſelf) the Emperors Ambasſador his anſwer <hi>(ut ſupra)</hi> wrote to me an ofter to come to my Houſe (which preventing by going to his) told me he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a returne of his viſite ſent by his Servant by a Servant of the others, who at the firſt entrance of his Mesſage (giving his own Maſter the title of <hi>Excellenza,</hi> and him the Venetian of Signioria <hi>Illuſtrif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſima,</hi>) ſaid his Excellency hoped to ſee him before his departure; which words (though of a double ſence of ſeeing him at his own Houſe, or at the others) taken as a courteſie, he deſired me to let him know (as I did) that he had ſpared to make Reply to his courteſie by his own (the Venetians Servant) becauſe the Title likely to be uſed by the Emperors Ambasſador, and juſtly to be returned, (conſidering the Republicks paritie with Crownd Heads) by the ſame Servant might perhaps breed further diſtaſte; but that I that was neutrall and unintereſted might let him know (as he deſired me I would) without danger of offence, or ingagement by application of Title, that he was moſt ſorry any ſuch difference ſhould hinder the Viſite, and acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of reſpects, which he and his Republique owed
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:170144:53"/>the Emperor, and his Miniſters, but that if any mean: could be found to carry things with indifferencie, that he would moſt readily imbrace it. That at the firſt, if he had not expresſed himſelf by thoſe different Titles given by his Secretary, he had himſelfe perſonally viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, and without further condition, put himſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his wiſdome. That regarding the duty he owed the State he repreſented, he would not leave his firſt hold; and finally for his own particular, he was his moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſervant &amp;c. To this the Emperors Ambaſſador re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, that he was ſorry (the difference ſtood ſo ſtifely upon between them) ſhould keep him from the acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of a perſon, of whom he had received ſo worthy reſpects; that he could not alter what he had once with good reaſon reſolved, never to treate <hi>del pare</hi> with the Venetian Miniſter. That what he ſtood upon, or had done, proceeded not (he proteſted) from any <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priccio</hi> of his own, or command of his Maſter, but meerly (as he knew of his own experience) according to the Stile, and manner held between the Emperors, and all Venetian Ambaſſadors <hi>ab antiquo,</hi> ſo deſired pardon for his freedome, preſented his love and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice &amp;c. The laſt Complement being returned to the Venetian Ambaſſador, the buſineſs ended without interview or further queſtion, or difference between them.</p>
                  <p>The 11. of <hi>April</hi> this Ambaſſador had his ſecond private Audience (fetcht from Denmark-Houſe by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by the ſervice of ſix or ſeven Barges) by the Earle of Aubigney, and other Lords and Gentlemen, landing at the Privy Staires at White-Hall, and paſſing through the Sheild Gallery, and the late Queens Lodgings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kings Privy Gallery, and his withdrawing roome there, where the King held diſcourſe with him an hour together <hi>Remotis arbitris;</hi> a day or two after he ran at Tylt in the Prince his company with the Lord <hi>Montjoy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Sunday following (April 14.) he was publickly feaſted in the Upper Houſe of Parliament, ſeated on his Majeſties left hand, at the diſtance of about three perſons between, and of one beneath. His Barons and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:170144:53"/>principall Gentlemen were placed at a Table ſet croſs at the upper end of the Court of Requeſts, accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at dinner by the Lord Treaſurer, the Preſident of the Councell, and the Earle of <hi>Rutland,</hi> who had been that day his conductour from Denmarke Houſe by water.</p>
                  <p>After dinner (as before) he was brought to his Chamber of repoſe, and ſome halfe an houre after fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thence by the ſame Lord (his conductour) to take leave of his Majeſty in the Roome where he had dined, and thence went to St. <hi>Jameſes</hi> to take leave alſo of the Princes Highneſs.</p>
                  <p>On Wedneſday the ſevententh of <hi>Aprill,</hi> and the eleaventh day of his ſtay here (having been all that time defrayed) he deparred hence with all his followers in ſix of the Kings Barges to <hi>Graveſend,</hi> where he was to imbarke in two Ships of the Merchants (appointed by the King, but paid by himſelfe) for Dunkirk. At his parting, he left his Majeſties Officers and Servants little fatisfied with the gratuities, being but ſmall Bracelet Chaines to the valew of ſcarſe eight or 10 <hi>l.</hi> a peece. To the Maſter of the Ceremonies (bringing him the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from his Majeſty) which was his Picture ſet in Gold richly inchaced with Diamonds, and hung at a Chaine of Diamonds, Rubies, and Pearles, valewed at 1600 <hi>l.</hi>) he gave a ſmall Jewell, worth little above eight pound, and for all his Travell and attendance a Baſon, and Ewer not of 30 <hi>l.</hi> valew. To the Guard then waiting being twenty foure he gave— 40 <hi>l.</hi> and to the Clerck of the Check, a Bracelet of Gold of about nine pounds valew. To me (who expected nothing, having had no command to attend him) he gave a ſmall Chaine of Excellent Workmanſhip (as a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berance (he ſaid) not a reward) worth ten pound be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the rare faſhion of it. To the Porters—five pound, to two of the Kings Coachmen dayly attending him—tend pound, to the hired Coachmen—five pound, he took away (without leave, or demand of him) the Biſhop of <hi>Spalato,</hi> a fault in him, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity offered his Majeſty (conſidering what noble

<note place="margin">(meaning the Spaniſh Ambaſsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor.)</note> whom he ſhould be pleaſed more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to favour) they would in that alſo ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to his pleaſure, and would be willingly abſent; but as for being preſent at either the proceſſion; or the Service in the Afternoone, they deſired (ſince they muſt not be at that in the Forenoone) that they might be excuſed if they came not all, the rather, becauſe they were invited to the Earle of Exeters at Wimbleton, and if they ſhould ſtay the proceſſion, they doubted
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:170144:57"/>they ſhould come thither (unmannerly) too late to Dinner, and returne to Court not ſoone enough to Evening Solemnity. With this meſſage, I returned to my Lord Chamberlain, and ſo had the next day the free uſe of their places at the Proceſſion, and of the Cloſet at the Service for the young <hi>Landsgrave,</hi> and his followers, whom I conducted in the Dinner time to the Banquetting Houſe, where the Prince ſupplying his Fathers place (his Majeſty being then indiſpoſed) the <hi>Landsgrave</hi> ſtood at his Highneſſe left hand (as the Spaniſh Ambaſſador did on his right) moſt part of the Dinner time.</p>
                  <p>The Ambaſſador of Ruſſia, being upon his departure, I carried to him—fifty pound from the Merchants of the Muſcovy company (but as ſent to him from the Lords of the Councell) ſo as the Company had directed me) with this formall meſſage) That whereas (different from ſome Ambaſſadors imployed from his Emperour) he had deſired money, and nor proviſions to be laid in in ſpecie for his feeding at Sea, that ſum of fifty pound, was ſent him according to Preſident, but exceeding in proportion; becauſe, whereas other Ambaſſadors (whereof one had thirty five men his followers, and the other fourſcore) had not had above forty pounds worth of Victualls for their whole Journey, the ſumm now ſent him was—fifty pound, but he ſeeming much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied with ſo ſmall proportion, and ſaying that Sir <hi>John Merrick</hi> Ambaſſador to his Emperour had had above—two hundrd pound given him for the like, made ſhew to refuſe it, whereupon I left him, when ſending his Interpreter after me downe the Stayres (not as I thought, to receive the money) but deſiring me to keep it, or leave it with the Steward of the houſe, I refuſe it, and ſaying, that this was a matter of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence (inferring that either the Lords of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell (in whoſe name I was to preſent the money) did not (in my Lord Ambaſsadors opinion) underſtand what they had to do, or that the Ambaſsador did do more then he ought, to the dishonour of the King my
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:170144:57"/>Maſter) I would have returned up to him to have taken the refuſall (as I ſaid to the Interpreter it became me) from the his Ambaſſadors own mouth; but on the ſtairs I met one of his ſervants, that brought order from his Maſter, that he ſhould (as he did) receive it.</p>
                  <p>The firſt of <hi>June</hi> following I repaired to him with a ſummons from my Lord Chamberlaine to take his leave the next day at Greenwich (whether we went by land in four Coaches, beſides the Kings for himſelf, his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, my ſelf, and his two Interpreters) and deſcending at the Garden gate, he was (at the entrance of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Roome at the foot of the back Privy Staires) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by my Lord <hi>Wentworth,</hi> and by him conducted up to the Roome at the end of the Kings Privy Gallery, and there took leave, reconducted by the ſame Lord to his Station, where meeting by chance with my Lord <hi>Cavendiſh,</hi> and upon my motion ſaluted by him, I made uſe of that civility ſo farre as to tell the Ambaſſador, that that Lord being at the foot of the Staires, when he went up, and his Interpreters gone up before, he could not acquaint him with the cauſe of his incounter there, which was (I ſaid) by command of his Majeſty. This officious lye I made, leaſt the Ambaſſador might have expected and found himſelf diſappointed of a ſecond Nobleman, (of precedent ranke to my Lord <hi>Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>) to receive him according to the former Style of reception of thoſe Ruſſians firſt and laſt Audience, and as I had the day before written to my Lord Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine, that it had been, and would be required; but his Lordſhip miſtaking, it being only an honour (he thought) proper for his dining with the King, and for his firſt Audience, and no other, it had been (without this deviſe, omitted, but this made uſe of, it was by him very thankfully accepted.</p>
                  <p>Two or three dayes after he was feaſted at his own Houſe (as he himſelf, though another place were offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, deſired) by the Merchants of the Muſcovy Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny whereof Alderman <hi>Freeman</hi> was Governor) with whom, with the reſt, and beſt of that Company, dined my ſelfe, and two or three other Gentlemen, that I
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:170144:58"/>was intreated to bring with me. Dinner being ended, and the Table uncovered; the Health to his Emperor was begun, and pledged round, then our Kings, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors Father (the Patriark) then the Princes, his own and others <hi>

This delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, there came in other Preſents, a gilded Bowle, and a peece of fine cloath to his Nephew, and to each of the Interpreters, and a peece of cloath for his Porceſt; after thoſe to each of his ſervants a pecce of cloth; ſo all more merrily then ſoberly parted.</p>
                  <p>Three or four dayes after the Merchants requeſted me to deliver him his Preſent of Plate in the Kings and Princes names (though provided at their charge.) I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it at Alderman <hi>Freemans</hi> Houſe neer the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, being gilt Bowles of ſeverall ſizes (only one Baſon and Ewer parcell gilt;) and for diſtinction of the Kings Preſent from the Princes, by my advice, they tied a peece of red ſilke Ribbin to every parcell of that, and a peece of white to this: the number of his Majeſties peeces, being fifteene, and of the Princes eight. With theſe beſtowed in two Hampers carried by two Porters I went (that they might not be ſuſpected, if met by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his Followers, to come from elſewhere then the Court, and from the King) firſt down to Queen Hithe, and the up to the Ambaſſadors at Saint <hi>Thomas A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles.</hi> Brought to his Houſe, I cauſed my man (after I had finiſhed my feighned complement in name of Majeſty, and of his Highneſs) to range the Plate orderly, each portion by it ſelf on a Table; that done, the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor with a formall Oration of thanks, took one of the Kings Bowles, and one of the Princes, and drank their Healths in each, inviting me the next day to Dinner, that he migh (he ſaid) expreſs his thankfulneſe (which ſuddenly at that inſtant he could not) for all my pains. The Preſent he made me the next day, and which after Dinner, was ſolemly brought into the Roome by ſixe
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:170144:58"/>ſeverall men, and carried before them, conſiſted of two paire of rich Sables, a lining for a Gowne of Sables Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, a lining for a Iub of white and yellow Fox Bellies, a Cup of ſilver gilded, worth five or ſix pound, and a Turkey Bow, and two Arrowes, worth altogether about thirty pounds.</p>
                  <p>The Duke <hi>de Soubiſe</hi> refuged hether from France up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on miſcarriage of ſome undertakings of his there,

                  <p>A day or two after, the Ruſſian Ambaſſador had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his Preſent, he ſent to me one of his Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with the requeſt that I would let the Lords know how the fifty pound ſent him for his Proviſions by Sea, was all laid out, and that I would intreat their Lordſhips in his behalfe for ſome addition. Further, that whereas in Lent he had forborne to take the firſt faſting week his Allowance of fiſh, that he might (as he had formerly (he ſaid) requeſted) have an allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in money (equivalent) for it. Alſo, that their Lordſhips would be pleaſed before his departure to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome courſe about a woman that had deceaved him (upon account of worke done for him) of—18 <hi>l.</hi> To theſe requeſts the Merchants (to whom I repaired for ſatisfaction, the buſineſſe being unfit for the Lords notice) intreated me to returne theſe anſwers in the name of the Lords (as I did.) That his Lordſhip (the Ambaſſador) might (if he had pleaſed) have received his proviſions in ſpecie (as his Predeceſſors had done) at other times, which would have taken away all Subject of further queſtion, but ſince he would have money, and himſelfe therewith provide Victualls, they had ſent him—50 <hi>l.</hi> which for the proportion of his revenew, exceeded all former Preſidents. That they could not
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:170144:59"/>exceed that ſumm, if they would prevent future in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences from ſuch Preſidents; but for his want of a weekes allowance, their Lordſhips had appointed the Merchants to let him have— 10 <hi>l.</hi> more; and for the Woman that had deceaved him, he muſt be righted by the Ordinary courſe of Law, which if he would leave behind him a Letter of Attorney to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute in his abſence, they would give it their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and order for the juſt diſpatch of it. Theſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers returned (as if I had received them from the Lords) he made little reply to, not without ſhews of inſatisfaction, onely the money which I delivered to his Interpreter, he not unwillingly accepted.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>interim</hi> of carrying the Preſent to this Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador and his demands mentioned, <hi>Seignior Valereſso,</hi> Ambaſſador Ordinary from Venice in place of <hi>Seignior Landi</hi> arrived at London, fetcht from <hi>Graveſend</hi> by the Maſter of the Ceremonies on Fryday the ſeaventeenth of <hi>June,</hi> and on Munday following had his firſt Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence at Greenwich, conducted to it by Land by the Lord <hi>Cavendiſh,</hi> Son to the Earle of Devonſhire, with the Lord <hi>Bruſe,</hi> and others in twenty five Coaches, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending his Majeſty, he reſted himſelfe in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell Chamber, and there entring the Preſence, was at the doore receiued by the Lord Chamberlain, there preſented by his Predeceſſor <hi>Seignior Landi,</hi> he ſpake breifely, and departed.</p>
                  <p>Having viſited his Predeceſſor the Saturday before, and after at the ſame time himſelfe (ſomething unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably perhaps before he had had his Audience) <hi>Seignior Landi</hi> ſeemed to complaine (as of a neglect caſt upon his Succeſſor) that he had not yet received a wellcome from his Majeſty by ſome perſon of Title, as had been (he ſaid) the Cuſtome of proceeding towards all his Predeceſſours. Wherewith I acquainted my Lord Chamberlain, brought for an anſwer from his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, that he underſtood not but that the Complement of wellcoming Ambaſſadors from the King upon their Arrivall, had been-onely uſed at ſuch times as their
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:170144:59"/>Audience was excuſed for having been deferred for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſome inſtant preſſing affaires of his Majeſty, but that for this time, the interim would be ſo ſmall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Arrivall, and his Audience, as that the viſit would hardly be given, or at the leaſt would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable, if omitted; which anſwer paſſed for currant both with him, and the other, as he profeſſed to me when I firſt viſited him after his Audience, onely he deſired that my Lord Chamberlain would but intimate his reaſon to him perſonally when he would next ſee him, that he might receive the more honour from his own Teſtimony, as he did after to his ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>His Predeceſſour next day after his Audience, took leave of his Majeſty, accompanied to it at Greenwich by the Lord <hi>North,</hi>

But they ſtaying, (their buſineſs with the Merchants, about compoſing the Eaſt-Indian differences being not yet concluded) divers underhand paſſages, and diſcourſes for and againſt the ſight of the Maske, were carried to and fro as much as might be to content them, and not diſpleaſe others.

In a word, when neither theſe reaſons, nor others would ſerve to ſtill their Exceptions againſt their not being invited, they were referred to adventure of content, or not content, and ſo were not at all invited, Onely a dozen of their followers had places aſſigned them over the Lord Chamberlains Box at the entrance into the Banquetting Houſe from the Princes Galleries.

There lodging the Ambaſſador by the Mayors Billetting, we paſſed three nights before we could be provided, (in that troubleſome time of ſo many mens landing) with Coaches, Carts, and Horſes for his proceeding to London. To which purpoſe ſending a Warrant, (which

                  <p>The next day the Marqueſs mentioned, and the other Ambaſſador Extraordinary <hi>Don Carlos de Coloma</hi> met us (Anſwerable to an aſſignation given by Sir <hi>Lewes Lewkner</hi>) about foure miles from London, with halfe a doſen more coaches. Then the Ambaſſadors quitting their own Coach, and entring the Princes, were all arrived in the Evening at Exceſter Houſe, their appointed Lodging, where Lodged alſo with them <hi>Don Hurtado de Mendoza</hi> out of his own, and the other Ambaſſadors election, after offer had been made him, both for his Lodging, and defraying at his Majeſties charge (but was excuſed by the Marqueſs <hi>de la Inojoſa</hi> with ſaying he ſhould be his gueſt while he remained in England) ſo much I ſignified the next Morning to <hi>Don Diego</hi> from my Lord Chamberlain, with intimation further, that if he found himſelfe not Lodged, or treated to his mind, he ſhould have other proviſions elſewhere, adding that his Majeſty (and particularly the Prince) had given my Lord Chamberlain an eſpeciall charge to do him honour in all things, and to procure him his full Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:170144:65"/>To this offer he replyed with many thanks, but with refuſall, ſaying, the Marqueſs was his kinſman and with him he would quarter, and defray himſelfe (the furniture and Hangings of his Chamber ſupplyed him from the King, being (he ſaid) an honour ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for him.) There he remained, and at three dayes end I was ſent to him from my Lord Chamberlain to know his deſire for his Audience, and to let him know withall, that if he had aeſſicted a ſpeedy diſpatch, his Lordſhip would write to the King for it, that going from London the Wedneſday, and coming that day or the next to Royſton, he might the next day after have his Audience, the King having deſſigned his remove from thence on Saturday to <hi>Fincham-brook,</hi> a place that afforded no commodity for his reception; or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if he were not preſt by his Affaires, he might be pleaſed to reſpite his Journey to the King, till his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſhould returne to Theobalds, where he would not be till a Fortnight after. This latter offer he made choyce of, as of the moſt proper allowance of time to provide himſelfe of Liveries <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for his followers, of which he came unprovided.</p>
                  <p>In the meane (within foure or five dayes of his Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall at London) his Lordſhip willed me to know of him if he would be pleaſed to receive viſit from him, and other Noblemen that owed, and would diſcharge their reſpects; which offer he thankfully accepted of, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived on the next day from his Lordſhip and the Earle of <hi>Arrundell</hi> coming to him both together. The thirteenth of <hi>October,</hi> the Marqueſs <hi>de la Inojoſa,</hi> and <hi>Don Carlos de Coloma</hi> ſet forth towards Royſton to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate the Prince his returne not yet ſeen by them, his Highneſſe remaining yet with the King, but being on their way as far as Buntingford, they there met a meſſage from Mr. Secretary <hi>Conway</hi> in name of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, either that they ſhould be pleaſed to come pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to his Majeſties Preſence (and from that to the Princes) and returne that night to Buntingford (Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton being a place, the meſſenger ſaid (as he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) of ill reception) or to ſtay at Buntingford that
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:170144:65"/>night, and have their Audience the next day, and ſo returne.</p>
                  <p>This choice ſeemed ſomewhat round, and of hard di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion to the Marqueſſe, and paſſed not without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception comparatively againſt the much different Treatment of the French Ambaſſador the weeke before, who had (he ſaid) both ſupped and Lodged in Court at Royſton (though this his Treatment was ſuddain, as was his coming thither by Poſt, with onely two Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men congratulate the Prince at his Arrivall) who prevended by the ſame Ambaſſadors Servant with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulation at his Landing at Durham Houſe Stayres in name of his Maſter, and having aſſured him he ſhould be the firſt Ambaſſador he would give acceſs to) his Highneſſe was immediately after ſent to from the Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Ambaſſador to the ſame congratulating purpoſe,
<note place="margin">The wind comming now about for France.</note> but he refuſed his demanded Audience with excuſe of his haſt of repaire to the King his Father.

To this, I brought him anſwer from the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs, that he had heard of his worth, deſired his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintarve, and good Correſpondence, and was ſorrey that any thing ſhould hinder it; but if it ſhould pleaſe him to honour him with a viſet; he could not exceed
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:170144:66"/>the Title, which other Miniſters of the King his Maſter had uſed; and ſo left it to his conſideration, whether he would, or not viſit him.</p>
                  <p>To a Serjeants Feaſt at the Middle-Temple, the French Ambaſſador had been invited in the firſt place, and after the Spaniſh, which known to this, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted in the ſence it ought, he excuſed his Preſence with ſome buſineſſe, that he doubted might at that time be brought him from his Majeſty. The French Ambaſſador came, and with him the Venetian, and the States Ambaſſador, who diſappointed of the company they were promiſed (of the Maſter of the Ceremonies) I met them there, and after dinner brought them to their Coaches.</p>

                     <hi>Don Hurtado de Mendoſa,</hi> after a moneths ſtay for his Audience, during the Kings abſence from London, received a Meſſage from my Lord Chamberlaine by Sir <hi>Lewes Lewkner,</hi> and by me, That ſince he had had ſo long a patience in attendance of his Audience here at London, his Majeſty would not adde further trouble to it, but come himſelfe hither to give it him. So the 13. of <hi>November,</hi> the King being come to Town the day before, the Earle of Rutland (who had in his Fleet brought him out of Spaine) was made choice of for his conduction to Court.</p>

                  <p>Here I think good to inſert for ſuture occaſions, and uſe to the Maſter of the Ceremonies, that Sir <hi>Lewes Lewkner</hi> reported to me, that when he came from Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in conduct of the Archdutches Ambaſſador <hi>Don
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:170144:68"/>Diego de Mexia,</hi> Mr. <hi>Van Mall</hi> Agent here for her High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, perſwaded him to take his place in one of the hired Coaches with ſome of the Ambaſſadors Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and with it to leade the way, leaving the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador to come in the Kings Coach in Company of ſuch perſons of Court Eminency, as himſelfe ſhould be pleaſed to make choyce of, which (though Sir <hi>Lewes</hi> and he ſtumbled at) he at laſt allowed of; but being come to London, he let <hi>Van Mall</hi> know, it had been ever the manner (and with good reaſon) that the Maſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Ceremonies imployed from the King for the Ambaſſadors honour, and to receive him at the Sea ſide, or elſewhere in his way to Court, was to have place with him in his Coach, unleſſe perhaps ſome Noble perſon were withall imployed in that Service; which aſſertion confirmed by him with divers Perſidents and Reaſons (the Marqueſs <hi>de la Inojoſa,</hi> and <hi>Don Carlos de Coloma,</hi> acknowledging that they had both ſeverally received him into their Coaches at their firſt Arrivall into this Kingdome) the Arch-Dukes, and <hi>Van Mall</hi> with acknowledgment of their Errour, allowed it for requiſite. One Reaſon given then for the fitneſs of the Maſter of the Ceremonies ſitting in Coach with Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors on the way, was that his Preſence ſo at hand was moſt uſefull, and neceſſary for avoydance of diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbing incounters from paſſengers or otherwiſe in the way; another, that it was fit, the Ambaſſador ſhould have the Maſter of the Ceremonies alwayes neere him for diſcourſe, and ſatisfaction upon Queſtions concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Countrey <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And laſtly, for the honour of the Maſter, that ſends ſuch a one to do honour by his conduct to the Perſon of the Ambaſſador.</p>
                  <p>Preparetion being made <hi>November</hi> the eighteenth for a great Feaſt by the Duke of Buckingham to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain principally <hi>Don Diego de Mendoza,</hi> and with him <hi>Don Diego de Mexia</hi> the Arch-Dukes Ambaſſador and his followers of quality.</p>
                  <p>The Marqueſs <hi>de la Inojoſa</hi> (it was intended) ſhould have been at it as was <hi>Don Carlos de Coloma,</hi> but for the difference mentioned of Precedence between him
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:170144:68"/>and the other Extraordinary; but the day before, the Duke ſending to him Sir <hi>George Goring</hi> with a meſſage that he was ſorry to underſtand he would be abſent from the entertainment he intended, becauſe of ſome inconveniences <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Marqueſs returned anſwer, that he knew of no ſuch inconveniences, but that if it had, or ſhould pleaſe the Duke to invite him, he would come to his Feaſt <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In ſequell hereof the next day at Evening (ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what before the invited Ambaſſadors ſhould ſet forth, and were attending the perſon that ſhould come to conduct them; the Duke ſent a Gentleman of his Chamber (Mr. <hi>Endimion Porter</hi>) which a <hi>Regalo</hi> of three large Flaskets full of Proviſion of the choiſeſt of three Courſes of Cates intended for the Feaſt; One full of cold meates for the Antepaſto; another with fat fowle, (raw, and ready for ſpit) of all ſorts; and a third of the beſt, and rareſt ſweet-meates, all preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with this meſſage, that the Duke kiſſed his hands, and would have held it an honour, and an happineſſe to have had his Company, but ſince he would not have it, he deſired him to taſt of what he had provided for him, at that at the taſting of it at his Supper, he would be pleaſed to drink the health of the King of England, as he would at the ſame drink the health of the King of Spaine. The Marqueſs immediate anſwer to this meſſage, was no more but this.</p>
                  <p>For the happineſſe my Lord Duke ſayes, he ſhould have had in my Company, he might have had it, if it would have pleaſed him to command it. After retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thanks for his Preſent, and ſaying, it was eaſie to conceive what the Feaſt would be, when a taſt of it was ſo rare, and plentifull; he gave the bringer fifty Crownes, bad the Company good night, and went to Supper privately in his Chamber. Soone after the Earle of Northampton being ſent for conductor to the invited Ambaſſadors. Theſe, after their reception at Yorke Houſe (the Dukes) they were there thus placed at the Table.</p>
                  <p>On the left hand of his Majeſty (who was there as

                  <p>The one and twentieth of <hi>November Don Diego Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tado de Mendoza,</hi> ſet forth for his departure with my attendance towards Dover, and being by me provided (at the Kings charge) with foure Coaches beſides the Kings coach with foure Horſes, and a day or two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his goods being ſent thither in the weekly retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Waggon, at the rate of five ſhillings ſix pence <hi>per cent.</hi> all the way by land at the Kings charge.</p>
                  <p>We laid the firſt night at Rocheſter, the next at Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury, and came the next day to Dover, where the wind ſtanding contrary, after he, and one <hi>Don Pedro de Aldeberandino,</hi> Nephew to Pope Clement the eight (glad to take the advantage of the Kings Ship for paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage) had in a ſmall Boat ſet forth the Haven, and were forced back againe (as the Kings Ship at the ſame time was) into the Downes, we went in the Kings coach to Deale, where expecting the wind two or three dayes with the patience of an hungry entertainment from a cloſe handed Ambaſſador (as his preſent to me at his parting from Dover (being but an old guilt Livery Pot, that had loſt his fellow, and was not worth above twelve pounds, accompanied with two paire of Spaniſh Gloves to make it almoſt thirteen, made good to my ſhame, and his) he at length imbarked for his Tranſport under the conduct of Sir <hi>Richard Ringley</hi> Admirall of the nar

                  <p>He was ſcarſe abroad when Letters overtook him (ſent from Spaine in the Marqueſs <hi>de Inojoſa</hi> Pack) with ſharpe reproofes for his reſumption to conteſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Precedence with the ſaid Marqueſs (who (it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, after the ſtyle of Spaine (different from ours, that gives the laſt Extraordinary the firſt place) was to have it for the reſpect of his being Gouncellour of State, <hi>Vizroy</hi> of <hi>Navar,</hi> and formerly Governour of Milan, which Letters not onely revoked the Commiſſion he had from the King of Spaine to the Arch-Dutches, and the King of France (as he ſhould return that way home) but commanded alſo his retrait immediately upon his Arrivall in Spaine, to his own Houſe (with a kind of Confinement) till he ſhould know the King his Maſters further pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>The Arch-Dutcheſs Ambaſſador <hi>Don Diego de Mexia</hi> parted from London about a week after, and having preſſed hard for liberty to be tranſported to the Port he came from of Mardick neere Dunkerk, could not obtaine it (for ſatisfaction it might ſeeme to the Hollanders, offended, and taking Exceptions at the manner, and place of his firſt paſſage with his Majeſties Convoy from that Towne, pretended to be then by them (at Sea beleaguered) ſo as he was forced to imbark at Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver for his Tranſport to Callaies in the Kings Ship commanded by Sir <hi>Richard Bingley.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Maske being prepared by the Prince (with the Duke of Buckingham, and others <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) for Twelfnight a meſſage was ſent from his Majeſty to the French Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador (by whom carried I could not learne) to this purpoſe. That whereas there was a Maske towards, and that his Majeſty was deſirous that the Marqueſs <hi>de la Inojoſa,</hi> who had not ſeene any in this Kingdome, ſhould be at it, he intended to viſit him alſo (the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:170144:70"/>French Ambaſſador, and in the firſt place, but would take it, as a reſpect to his ſatisfaction, if (to avoid the incounter, and queſtion about their Precedence) he might before hand know, that he would be abſent, framing ſome ſuch excuſe, as he ſhould think fitteſt. To this the Ambaſſador returning at that inſtant no ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieing anſwer, he ſoone after intreated the Earle of <hi>March</hi> to preſent one from him to his Majeſty in theſe words. That about two yeares ſince upon the like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, he had received the like meſſage, but knowing how ſtrongly his Majeſty ſtood then affected to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lience with Spaine, he would give him no diſtaſt, but with excuſe of his indiſpoſition kept himſelfe abſent, that if he ſhould now againe do the like, he ſhould in the ſight of the world put a ſcorne upon himſelfe, and do an unanſwerable wrong to the King his Maſter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween whom, and the King of Spaine his Majeſty knew (if he would be pleaſed to declare his knowledge) that there was no queſtion to be made of the right of Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; that in this regard, he humbly beſeecht his Majeſty to proceed plainely, and fairely without uſeing any more colourable, or alternative Invitations (as he had done,) which might imply a Parity, in no ſort to be yeelded to by the King his Maſter, in whom was the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute right of Priority. That if his Majeſty intended to invite him, he hoped he would intend alſo to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain him with fitting reſpects, for come he would, if he ſhould be invited, and if he ſhould not, and the other ſhould, he would proteſt againſt it, and immediatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne home to the King his Maſter with the account of his Treatment. That further his Majeſty would be pleaſed to conſider, that whereas he was at that inſtant ſending a Perſon of quality to the King his Maſter, he might with reaſon expect, that whatſoever want, or omiſſion he (the French Ambaſſador) ſhould meet with here, it would be returned in France in the ſame mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. This meſſage (the ſubſtance whereof he repeated to me two or three dayes after) was brought little ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to the King, then it was made known to the Marqueſs <hi>de la Inojoſa,</hi> who inſtantly ſent for the Maſter of the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:170144:70"/>Ceremonies, and in a ſtorming manner gave him a meſſage (repeating it twice or thrice) to be delivered to his Majeſty by him in this ſence; that he knew what reſpect had been formerly given the King of Spaines (his Maſters Miniſters) eſpecially thoſe that had been here Extraordinary, and what alternative courſe of invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had been uſed with them, and the French; that he looked for no leſs honour to be done to him then to his Predeceſſors, and that ſince it was both his right and his turne to be now invited, he would expect it, beſeeching his Majeſty not underhand to invite the French Ambaſſadors (as he knew (he ſaid) he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended) but to invite him directly, and openly firſt, and only, that ſo if (he <hi>Inojoſo</hi>) muſt be made a Subject for gazers abroad, it might be to ſome purpoſe, and that he might have a juſt, and an apparent cauſe to write to his Maſter of the wrong done him here in his Miniſter, with other words in an high Spaniſh Stile to that purpoſe, which when the Maſter of the Ceremonies had twice or thrice requeſted him to temper, to take time to think better of them, and to communicate his intended meſſage with his Collegue <hi>(Don Carlos)</hi> he only yeelded to ſatisfie him in this laſt of communicating his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (as he did that night with that much more tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and conſiderate Gentleman) from whom wreſting (as <hi>Don Carlos</hi> himſelf after acknowledged) a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent for the carriage of that meſſage to the King by Sir <hi>Lowes Lewkner,</hi> the Maske was thereupon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpited &amp;c.</p>

That the Queen having been deſirous for the long acquaintance ſake that had paſſed between her, and the Dutches <hi>de Cheve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reux,</hi> to have her neer her, at the time of her (the Dutcheſſes) Delivery, and lying in (then towards) would have her lodg'd in the Kings Houſe at Richmond, and that ſhe having her lodging there, it was fit that the Duke her Husband ſhould have his there alſo. And as for Monſieur <hi>de Fiat,</hi> it concerned both his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties profit and his eaſe to bring him together with the other Ambaſſador to one Houſe, when a ſecond kept for them at London, at the Kings charg (as was the Dukes at Richmond) would be both dangerous in regard of the Sickneſs, troubleſome to the Kings Officers by their ſerving in of proviſions for Diet, at two ſeverall places, and of great expence. Beſides, it was intended, that if thoſe Ambaſſadors ſhould have come to lye at Hampton Court from Richmont, the King would have inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly removed to Windſor, or to ſome other of his Houſes. To this the Ambaſſador <hi>Bleinville</hi> anſwered, he knew not that, but this he knew (he ſaid) that Lodgings were marked for the other within Hampton Court, and to be made uſe of there at their pleaſure, adding that the Earles of Carliel and Holland (late Ambaſſadors to the King his Maſter) when they were with his Majeſty at Saint <hi>Cermans,</hi> were quartered neere the Kings Houſe, yet would not reſt contented with their Lodging, till they had gotten within his Majeſties own Houſe two or three roomes furniſhed for their retraite, and to lodge in at their pleaſure, though indeed they ſpared to make ſuch uſe of them. In concluſion, I ſaid, that neither his Majevty, nor the King his Father had ever lodged any Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador in their Houſes, while they themſelves lodged in them, and that his Majeſty now would be loth to make a Preſident, that would hereafter beget him ſo great a trouble, as this was like to be, and that therefore his Majeſty hoped, that the Ambaſſador would not take it in ill part (if deſirous to give him ſatisfaction, and to
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:170144:84"/>treate him in all, as the Repreſentant of the King his Maſter) he did in this not correſpond with his deſires &amp;c. Having ſaid thus much to him as from the King, he (not without ſome countenance of inſatisfaction, and with intimation, that he had but propounded it only, and would leave it to the Kings conſideration, and pleaſure,) there was for that time no further queſtion made of it.</p>
                  <p>To dayes after deſiring me to procure him an Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, I intended the King for it at his return from Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and though it were late, I was ſent to him with his Majeſties pleaſure for his immediate acceſs (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further Ceremony) his Majeſty being to returne the next day early to Hunting, ſo the Ambaſſador re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing to Court at ſix in the Evening, (with reception of the Preſident of the Houſhold at the foot of the ſtaires, and of the Chamberlain at the top) he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced to his Majeſtie in his withdrawing Chamber, all his Followers remaining in the Preſence.</p>
                  <p>The King (upon aſſurance of the Plagues beginning to leſſen at London, and in other places neer about) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to Windſor, and Hampton-Court, and leaving the Queen ſome few dayes at Salisbury, the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor being upon his departure to follow his Majeſty, I let him underſtand, that according to our Cuſtome, he was not to have his Poſt-horſes defrayed (though all the reſt had been ſo hitherto) when (almoſt at the inſtant I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Letter from the Earle of Carliel (to whom in abſence of my Lord Chamberlaine I had written for a formall reſolution to that purpoſe) ſignifying his Majeſties pleaſure, that he ſhould be defrayed for his Poſt-horſes alſo, (as he had been for his Coaches and Carriages) but with a proteſtation, injoyned to be made by me as from his Majeſty to the Ambaſſador (as it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mallv was, when I delivered my meſſage) that he ſhould be the laſt, who ſhould receive that Treatment, and that he ſhould have alſo his lodging provided in Court at Hampton, which favour of his Majeſty he (at leaſt in appearance) accepted of moſt thankfully. This Letter mentioned was written to me from the Earle of Carlile
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:170144:85"/>which ſiginification of his Majeſties pleaſure appearing in it for diſcharge of the Ambaſſadors Poſt-horſes) upon an account I had given that Lord (at the inſtant of his departure with the King) what words of reſentment had falne from the Ambaſſador, after I had told him of our Cuſtome here, as before in theſe formall termes and with paſſion anſwerable.</p>
                  <p>He had well obſerved (he ſaid) how he had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated here ſince his comming in a different manner from other of his Nation and quality; that Monſieur <hi>de Fiat,</hi> and Monſieur <hi>de Villiaviller</hi> were not perſons to ſtand with him in compariſon, otherwiſe then as they were his Maſters Ambaſſadors, yet had they received better reſpects then he.

That the Earle of Carliel though he had lodgings ordained for him at Saint <hi>Germaines</hi> in the Chancellors Houſe, the beſt of the Town, and neer the Court) would not be contented, till he had his lodging Chamber, and Anti-chamber in the Kings own Houſe, and had been treated for ſome eighteen moneths in manner as the world knew, yet that he an Ambaſſador (who for ought he knew was not to ſtay two moneths here) was refuſed reſpects and treatment anſwerable in many things. That he ſaw well enough what had been put upon him from time to time, whereof, but for doing ſo ill an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, as to raiſe difference or debate between the two Kingdomes (which would be an ill Servants and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects part, eſpecially in times of our Warrs with Spain)

That further, for that one particular of Poſt-Horſes, one or 200. crowns, more or leſs, was a poore thing in his conſideration, which to be defrayed, or not defrayed, was nothing to him in his own perſon, but as he repreſented the perſon of the King his Maſter, he was bound to take and give notice of it. Theſe, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the like Stommachous Speeches he let fall in my hearing, which reported by me to my Lord of Carliel, and by him to the King, brought forth the Letter, and with it the allowance ſpecified. The day before his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, when I preſumed that his Majeſties Officers had or would defray the Lodgings taken up, and made uſe of for his Followers, I found the Harbengers all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, and no Order left for their diſcharge.

                  </p>
                  <p>Saturday the 28. of <hi>October,</hi> after Dinner, when (all being ready we all ſuppoſed the Ambaſſador would inſtantly depart) he called me into his Chamber and imparted to me (with requeſt of my Secreſie) his deſigne to ſtay behind (<hi>pour ſe purger</hi> (as he profeſt) to purge himſelfe (but whether of the humours of the Marqueſs <hi>de Bleinvill,</hi> or of Monſieur <hi>l'Ambaſſadure</hi> taking the opportunity of the Queens ſtay behind the King, for his more freedom of acceſs to her Majeſty I know not) there he ſtayed, (intreating me to proceed
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:170144:86"/>with the groſſe of his Traine, retaining with him two or three Gentlemen, and the Kings coach, and aſſuring me he would follow on Monday. Not to contradict him in his courſe deſigned, I without reply or excuſe, parted that day with his Steward, and followers in five coaches (followed by ſeaven carts for his Baggage,) and forty foure ſadle Horſes, and comming that night to Andever; we had word brought us thither, that the carriage with his Plate was not that day come forth of Salisbury, a knaviſh carter when he ſee us all parted, taking advantage, and ſtealing away with his carriage before it came to loading, ſo as leaving the Marſhall of the Ceremonies behind to attend that charge, we went on that night to Hart-ford Bridge, then reſting all Sunday (more for the Frenches Satisfaction in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance of their Lords Plate, not yet come, then for the duty they would have paid the day by reſt, though they had their Maſs in the Inn, but firſt with requeſt of myapprobation for the fitneſs or unfitneſs of it, in regard of ſcandall) we were the next day at Kingſton, where at the furtheſt end of the Towne Eaſt-ward, the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors Houſe was appointed, but not yet (by default of ſome of the Kings Officers) Lodgable; ſo as returning into the Town, we Lodged in Inns, and elſewhere, as we could on ſuch a ſuddaine be provided, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out French murmurs, till they were the third night after better beſtowed in the quarter ordained from them. This Ambaſſador being not yet come from Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, the Gentleman of his Horſes, and of chiefe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage in his Affaires (in obſervation of his Lords deſire, and the Kings pleaſure, ſignified to him by the Earle of Carliel, that the Ambaſſador ſhould have a Chamber in Court (not (as was miſ-underſtood to lye in it, but onely for his retrait, as is before mentioned) intreated the Earle of Carliel to move the King for his favour to that purpoſe, when I had already for prevention poſſeſt his Majeſty and my Lord Chamberlain, that the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors intention of demand of a Lodging in Court, was with the like limitation, as the Earles of Carliel and Holland had had theirs in the Court of France, <hi>viz.</hi> onely at time to retyre to.</p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:170144:86"/>
                  <p>In concluſion it was the pleaſure of his Majeſty (and for ſuch made known by my Lord of Carliel) that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting no cloath of State,
<note place="margin">The yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers had onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſet one up in his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber at Court, but I inſtantly hindred it as not fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I gave account to the Lord Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, and was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded for it.</note> which from firſt to laſt of his ſtay there was not allowed him in Court, (though he had one (as all Kings Extraordinary Ambaſſadors have) in his private Houſe at Kingſton) and having in his Chamher the allowance onely of a Gentleman, and two Groomes to lye by him in Pallet, he ſhould be Lodged in Court as a particular or private Perſon, and not otherwiſe, for avoidance of future trouble to the King by Preſident.</p>
                  <p>This obtained, I ſought to prevent another incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency, by acquainting my Lord Chamberlain and Carliel with the Expectation I ſaw towards of having his Dyet provided in Court, which would have made that publick, which was intended private.</p>
                  <p>To prevent this, I had order to fall (as I did) in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with the Gentleman of his Horſes, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the Kings mind to him (as I underſtood it.) I ſaid from report, and collection) that it was intended he ſhould have no other Dyet, then what he had at King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton by proviſion there from the Kings Officers, and that if he would eate at Court at any time, it might be at the Table of the Queens Lord Chamberlain, or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where there) as a private Perſon, ſending thither,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Monſieur</hi> de Tilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</note> when he would from Kingſton part of his proviſion to have it dreſt in Court for increaſe of his Dyet at the Table of her Majeſties Lord Chamberlain; but this was but diſcourſe, and to little purpoſe, while the Ambaſſador himſelfe remained yet with the Queen at Salisbury.</p>
                  <p>The ſtay of his there longer, then he at the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended (or at the leaſt in ſhew pretended) gave me the liberty to ſiſit my home (then at Brocket Hall) for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait from the ſickneſſe) till a meſſenger bringing me the news that the Ambaſſador was come to Hampton Court, I the next morning returned thither, and that Afternoone accompanied him with two coaches each with foure Horſes (appointed for his continuall Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice) to the ſight of Noneſuch. Theſe two coaches I increaſed to three with two Horſes to each as more
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:170144:87"/>uſefull then one, and capable of his followers for their dayly paſſage to and from Court to Kingſton. The fourteenth of <hi>November,</hi> that he might take poſſeſſion of the honour allowed him by his Majeſty to be Lodged in Court, he commaded ſome of his ſtuffe of more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Service to be tranſported thither, he himſelfe that Evening following it, and was there Lodged in the Garden Lodgings, where had been ſometime quartered the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> before her marriage, but preſuming to have his Kichin allowed him there alſo <hi>(ut ſupra)</hi> he was refuſed it) for having by his Servant formerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it by my Lord Chamberlain (as hath been touched) his Lordſhip now ſent for me, and gave me in charge this to ſay to him. That he beſeecht him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive, his Majeſty did, and would give him all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects due to his quality and perſon, and that for his owne particular, he had faithfully endeavoured to do him his beſt Service for his Accommodation in Court according to his own deſires; but he found his Majeſty abſolutly reſolved not to give way to what he requeſted concerning the having of a kitchin, and ſome other Lodgings for ſome of his Gentlemen for conveniency ſake.</p>
                  <p>This meſſage delivered by me, he asked me, how the King would have him live in Court without eating? I anſwered, It was never intended (for ought I knew) that he ſhould have further then his firſt demand, which was a Lodging or two for his repoſe ſometime, or at the moſt to lye in, with a Pallet or two, and one Gentleman for his attendance, as had been intimated to his Eſquire before, and that for his Dyet, he might be pleaſed to take it, (and augment it as he ſhould think fit with ſome of his own diſhes brought thither from Kingſton) at the Table of the Queens Lord Chamberlain <hi>(ut Supra)</hi> To this he gave this peremptory reply; Howſoever his Eſquire had let him know, that he muſt be there in his Lodgings with limitation as a private perſon, he was never of the mind to aſſent to that diſtinction ſo much againſt the King his Maſters honour, to be Lodged (as the King of Frances Ambaſſador at Kingſton, and as the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:170144:87"/>Marqueſſe <hi>de Bleinvill</hi> in the Kings Houſe) but that both the Earle of Carliel had told him it was not intended,
<note place="margin">Becauſe at Kingſton he had a State ſet up and his Table kept.</note> but that he ſhould be treated in his Lodging in every thing as became an Ambaſſador, and he himſelfe alſo did now proteſt for it, that he would not be, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine there, but abſolutly under that title, and would inſiſt upon his Accommodation in all things there, as an Ambaſſador from ſo great a King, as the King his Maſter. Which reſolution of his I having made known to my Lord Chamberlain, his Lordſhip acquainted the King with it, and preſently called me to the Preſence of his Majeſty in his Withdrawing Chamber, where after I had repeated the Ambaſſadors anſwer, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty commanded me to returne to him with his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure thus plainly and particularly expreſt. That the Ambaſſador might remember, that having requeſted earneſtly the favour to have a Lodging in his Court to retyre to onely, he would not at firſt aſſent to it, till up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Wives earneſt intreaty (he being loth to deny her the firſt requeſt ſhe had made to him) was content to yeeld to it, but that he never intended (no more then he (the Ambaſſador himſelfe had demanded) that he ſhould have his Kitchin there, or any other Lodging for any of his followers; except for ſome ſuch as were of neceſſary Service about his Perſon. That Carliel and Holland being in France had never any ſuch fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour done them there, and that he would have Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Bleinvill</hi> know, he valewed their condition not leſſe then his, rather more, regarding the buſineſſe they then treated on (being of an higher quality then that he now had in mannage) that notwithſtanding all this, he intended no ſuch diſtinction of Lodging him there as a private Perſon, with wrong to his publick quality, that he would in all reſpects treat him ſo, (the free uſe of his Houſe reſerved) and that he hoped he would not preſs him further to what was againſt his likeing, and which he intended not to grant him, ſo deſired him to reſt ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>Having carried this his Majeſties pleaſure to the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, he made no further anſwer then this. That he
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:170144:88"/>ſaw his Majeſty had beſtowed a favour on him, which he meant he ſhould not make uſe of, in giving him a lodging to lye in, and no Kitching, to dreſs his meate in, and without eating he could not live. That he would onely take himſelfe to my Lord of Carlile for juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what he had told him of his Majeſties intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he ſhould be lodgd in Court, not (as was told him by his Eſquire) as a private Perſon, but as an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, and ſo might expect all Termes anſwerable, that in the ſtile of an Ambaſſador he expected, and had order from the King his Maſter to expect, and ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Treatment in all things as his Miniſter; and that if he failed of this, he would demand of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty a particular Audience for his ſatisfaction to that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>When I had conveyed all this to the Kings know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge by my Lord Chamberlain, and that the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor had perſonally conferred about it with his Lordſhip, and with my Lord of Carliel alſo, I knew not how it come about by thoſe Lords ſatisfaction (when perhaps they ſaw no other remedy) or rather by the Queens once more mediation with the King in the Ambaſſadors behalfe, he had at length all he craved both for his Kitchin in Court (part of his Dyet being deducted out of that allowed him at Kingſton) and for inlargment of his Lodgings, having all thoſe aſſigned him next the River in the Garden, where ſometimes Lodged the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> but he could not obtaine allowance for any of his Gentlemen to be Lodged there, except onely ſuch Servants as were of immediat Attendance.</p>
                  <p>The next day he had an Audience (but for other buſineſſe this being cleered) and the two and twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of <hi>November</hi> following, another.</p>
                  <p>By this time Sir <hi>Lewes Lewkner</hi> Maſter of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies had by his freinds in Court ſo ſollicited his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the Service of his charge, as the Venetian Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador (ſatisfied with a kind of acknowledgement from him) was no hindrance to his re-attendance upon this, and other Ambaſſadors as there was occaſion.</p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:170144:88"/>
                  <p>The Coronation being ordained for the ſecond of <hi>February,</hi> two dayes before it my Lord Chamberlain ſent Sir <hi>Lewes Lewkner</hi> to this Ambaſſador for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his finall reſolution (having made ſome queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it) whether or no he would be preſent at the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, when I meeting Sir <hi>Lewes</hi> neere the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors Houſe, we went both together to him, and after ſome ſmall time of conference between them two part (I called too by the Ambaſſador) we both received from him this anſwer, That he would not be preſent at the Coronation for two or three regards; the one was, that his religion tied him not to aſſiſt at our prayers, and Church Ceremonies, but herein (he ſaid) he was not ſo ſcrupulous as that he would not be content, <hi>pour le reſpect du Roy de la grand Britaine de vouloir faire quel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que petite breſche a ſa conſcience.</hi> But that which moſt prevailed with him for his abſence was (he ſaid) that he had not been proceeded with in his Invitation, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Perſon, and quality of the King of France's Ambaſſador, and (as he underſtood) the King of Spains Ambaſſador had heretofore been in a larger, and more noble meaſure. That he was not before hand called (as the other had been (at other Solemnities towards) to confer, and to be made acquainted with the ſtyle, and condition of his Treatment, and placing at the ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, whereof he had received hitherto no other notice or allowance, then what was given, and to be given to the Venetian and States Ambaſſadors. That further for him to be a Spectator where the Queen, his Maſters Siſter, excuſed her preſence, and her participation of the Solemnity of Crowning, would be an incongruity, with other the like exceptions to this purpoſe, amongſt which one was (which (he ſaid) he had reaſon to take) againſt his Treatment here, as not agreeable to his quality. Whereat I interpoſed this queſtion, whether, his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint in that regard extended to that particular of his Invitation, or to his Treatment in generall? he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, it extended onely to that of his Invitation, and that for the reſt of his Treatment, he had received ſuch reſpects, and uſage from his Majeſty, as he could not
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:170144:89"/>except againſt it. Parting with this anſwer, we incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the Venetian Ambaſſador where he then was, at the Lodging of Mr. <hi>Roſsorfe</hi> the King of Bohemias Agent, and could not in a long time drive him from the ſuſpition of the Ambaſſadors earneſt, that all this was to deceive, and amaze him, that he might not come to the Coronation, but by his abſence run the hazard of the like affront, as was put upon him at King <hi>James</hi> his Funerall, till reſolved in the Evening, he made that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, which he had before intimated at his Houſe, that he durſt not be preſent at the Coronation, if the French Ambaſſador were not, not (he ſaid) for ſcruple of conſcience (as the French pretended) ſince he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to underſtand it as an Act of State, and not of Religion) but for the ſcandalls ſake, which might grow, with cenſure to him for aſſiſting in one of our Churches at our Churches Ceremonies, in company of the States Ambaſſador (reckoned an Heretique) during a Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, whereat the French Ambaſſador (a Catholick) had refuſed his Preſence. So as neither of both the Ambaſſadors came, (though the Venetian by queſtion examined all wayes poſſible how he might have a ſight of it without notice of any man) in ſome corner, but none found allowable, and I excuſing my attendance on him, as being a publick Officer, that ſhould thereby diſcover him for a publick Miniſter, if I ſhould be ſeen neere and ſerving him.) There was onely preſent the States Ambaſſador, whom Sir <hi>Lewes Lewkner</hi> fetching from his Houſe in the morning, while I accompanied his Wife, and Daughters by water from the Savoy Staires, we were all let in at a little poſterne door on the South ſide of King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſevenths Chappell upon a Scaffold there, and there beheld the whole Solemnity. The French Ambaſſador had his ſtand (as he ſaid he would) at the Houſe of Sir <hi>Abraham Williams</hi> neere the Gate-Houſe of the Pallace-yard in company of the Queen (as <hi>Bleinvill</hi>) which was his owne diſtinction) and not as Ambaſſador) where (with her Majeſty) he had a view of the King in his paſſage from Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Hall, to the Church, and back againe.</p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:170144:89"/>
                  <p>The Queens Reaſon (as it was voyced) for not being Crowned together with the King, was becauſe ſhe could not (they ſaid) by her Religion be preſent at our Church Ceremonies, where ſhe muſt have had divine Service celebrated by our Biſhops, and not by thoſe of her own Religion (as was demanded) for her Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>The ninth of <hi>February</hi> following, the King was to ride to Parliament, and though the Venetian Ambaſſador had aſſurance from me, that the French was to have no other ſtand appointed him for view of that Solemnity, then the company of the Queen as a private Perſon, and not as an Ambaſſador, yet his jealoſie of looſing the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended right of his Re-publick in Parity with Crowned-heads, made him apprehend the allowance of an Houſe taken up for him in King-ſtreet (about the midſt of it, where alſo was aſſigned one for the States Ambaſſador at the charge of his Majeſty) to be an Abatement of his reſpects, which he affirmed was, that he was to ſtand in the ſame Houſe and place with the French Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, but in the end pacified, he accepted of it; In the meane time a difference that fell out about the place for the Queen (ſhe affected to ſtand in the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetting Houſe, or in the Privy-gallery (when the King had given reaſons for her better fight in the houſe of the Counteſs, Mother to the Duke of Buckingham, next the Gate in Kings-ſtreet) was a Subject for ſome diſcontent &amp;c. ſo far as the Ambaſſador <hi>Bleinvill,</hi> ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Majeſty to have been the cauſer of it, had the next day a meſſage brought him by the Lord <hi>Conway,</hi> that it was his Majeſties pleaſure that he ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare further acceſſe to the Kings or Queens Preſence; which he ſtorming at, and excepting againſt as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity offered to his Repreſentative quality, demanded by two or three ſeverall meſſengers, Audience of his Majeſty, for knowledge of the Reaſons of his reſtraint, but was refuſed it with this limiting diſtinction. If he demanded Audience for any particular buſineſs concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King his Maſter, he ſhould readily have it, but
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:170144:90"/>if for himſelfe to expoſtulate his own grievances, the King did abſolutly let him know, that if he came to him, he would not ſee him, ſo as the Ambaſſador replying; that he was here for the King his Maſter, and not for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and that the refuſall of his Audience touched the perſon he repreſented, and not his own. He the next day refuſed the Kings diet, and betook him to his own, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Lodging taken for him at Durham-Houſe, and removing with the chiefe of his Traine to Greenwich, whence two days after returning to London, he with the Kings permiſſion had a ſight of the Queen, and the next day went againe to Greenwich. He had in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim diſpatched two or three Couriers, one following another with an account of all; but at Dover (the Ports being by Order ſhut before hand) none of them could be allowed paſſage till after fourteen or fifteen days (when Maſter <hi>Walter Mountacue</hi> had been purpoſely ſent from the King) they were opened, and the Ambaſſador had his liberty of ſending his meſſenger.</p>
                  <p>About a moneth or ſix weekes after, this <hi>Malantenda,</hi> this Ambaſſador, receiving Order from the King his Maſter for compoſing of his affaires, and differences here, and for applying of himſelfe to his Majeſties plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, he had an Audience or two, and peecing up mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, took his leave at a ſolemne Audience at White-Hall Preſence, conducted to it by the Earle of Holland, the Kings Guard attending their Captain through the ſtreets, but what congruity (as was done before) <hi>quere.</hi> and two or three dayes after departed; firſt, for a night or two to his private Lodging at Greenwich, and thence to Dover, accompanied by Sir <hi>Lewes Lewkner,</hi> but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defrayed on the way, leaving the Kings Officers and Servants (my ſelfe in particular, after my ſo long, and painfull attendance) ill ſatisfied with his none at all, or moſt unworthy acknowledgements.</p>
                  <p>About the middle of <hi>February,</hi> The Merchants of the Eaſt Indian Company (having ſignified to his Majeſty, That a Ship (long held for loſt, and then arrived at Portſmouth) had brought in her an Ambaſſador from

                  <p>Theſe Merchants (with an affected honour, beyond that done to the other Perſian Ambaſſador Sir <hi>Robert Sherley</hi>) had procured the Kings Coach to be drawn with eight Horſes (as with the more grace to the latter to diſgrace the former.)

There reſting himſelfe two dayes, his Audience was ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited, and aſſigned for Shrovetueſday following, which ſuſpected by Sir <hi>Robert Sherley</hi> and his friends to be a plot of the Merchants by ſo haſtning an Audience to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent his repair to Court, and to prepoſſeſs the King with the new Ambaſſadors Reports) he intreated the Earle of Cleaveland (Husband to his Neece) to accompany him at a Viſite he would beſtow on the ſaid Amdaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor for his Wellcome, and for the declaring of his own quality of Ambaſſador from the ſame King, from whom he had ſo long negotiated here under that Title. To this purpoſe the Earle of Cleaveland addreſſing himſelf to the Lord Chamberlaine for his favour in procuring from the Lord <hi>Conway,</hi> Principall Secretary, the Letters of Credence brought to King <hi>James</hi> by Sir <hi>Robert Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley.</hi> The Lord Chamberlaine excepting his medling in it, as being (he ſaid) no duty of his place. From him the Earle of Cleaveland, went to the Duke of Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, and by his meanes obtaind allowance from his Majeſtie for the Lord <hi>Conway</hi> to impart them for ſo much uſe and ſight as might ſerve the Ambaſſador <hi>Sherleys</hi> turne for the others ſatisfaction; ſo as my Lord Cleaveland having gotten them into his hands, he the morning that the new come Ambaſſador, was in the afternoone to have Audience departed with the Kings Coach, and ſeven other (eight or nine Gentlemen and my ſelf accompanying him) to Sir <hi>Roberts Sherleys</hi> Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on Tower Hill; whence being ready to ſet forth towards the other Ambaſſadors; I propounded the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:170144:91"/>of ſending to him before (to avoid the incivility as it might be interpreted of a ſurpriſe) with ſignification of our inſtant coming to him to Viſite him. To this his Anſwer met us on the way without other comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then that we might come. Entring the Hall, (where he then was ſitting in a chair on his legs double under him, after the Perſian Poſture) and affording no motion of reſpect to any of us, Sir <hi>Robert Sherley</hi> gave him a ſalutation, and ſate downe on a ſtoole neer him, while my Lord of <hi>Cleaveland</hi> by an Interpreter ſignified, in three words, the cauſe of the Ambaſſador <hi>Sherleys</hi> and his and our comming to him, but with little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne of regard from him, till I informing the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (of the new Ambaſſador) what my Lords quality was, he let fall his Truſt-up-leggs from his chaire, and made a kinde of reſpect to his Lordſhip. This done, Sir <hi>Robert Sherley,</hi> unfoulding his Letters, and (as the Perſian uſe is in reverence to their King) firſt touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his eyes with them, next holding them over his head, and after kiſſing them, he preſented them to the Ambaſſador, that he receiving them, might performe the like obſervance, when he ſuddenly riſing out of his chaire, ſtept to Sir <hi>Robert Sherley,</hi> ſnarcht his Letters from him, toare them, and gave him a blow on the face with his Fiſt, and while my Lord of Cleaveland ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping between kept off the offer of a further violence; the Perſians Son next at hand flew upon Sir <hi>Robert Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> and with two or three blows more, overthrew him, when Maſter <hi>Maxwell</hi> of the Bedchamber, and my Lord of Cleaveland neareſt to him, pulling him back (while we of the company laid hands on our Swords (but not drawing them, becauſe not any one Sword or Dagger was drawn by the Perſians) my Lord of Cleaveland re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated to the Ambaſſador the danger, and inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the Fact, ſaying, that if he, and the Gentlemen there with him had not borne more reſpect to that King whom he repreſented then (he the Ambaſſador) had done to the Letters ſhewed him for juſtification of the others quality, neither he, nor thoſe about him, that had committed that inſolency ſhould have gone alive out of
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:170144:91"/>that place. After theſe words, he made ſome ſhew of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, and ſaid, he was ſorrey he had offended his Lordſhip, and us by his Act which he had performed (tranſported with extreame rage againſt a Perſon that had dared to counterfeit the King his Maſters hand (which was alwayes (he ſaid) ſet on the top of his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) when theſe Letters he had ſhewed had it on the back-ſide) and to heare (as he had done) that ſo meane a fellow, and an Impoſter, ſhould preſume to ſay, he had married the King his Maſters Neece.</p>
                  <p>To this Sir <hi>Robert Sherley</hi> (who was in the meane time retyred behind the company, amazed and confounded with his blow and Treatment) ſtept in and anſwered. That he never ſaid he had married the Kings Neece, but the Queens kinſwoman; and that for the manner alleadged of ſigning his Letters, it was true, that the King of Perſia, in all imployments of his own Subjects to Forren Princes, or in writing to them, uſed to ſigne above in the front of his Letters, but that when he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed a ſtranger to any Forren Prince, his ſignature was uſually affixed on the back ſide of his Letters, that before their opening, they might ſhew who ſent them. To this the Ambaſſador replyed with ſcornfull looks onely, we all with little or no reſpects to him departed, and conducting Sir <hi>Robert Sherley</hi> to his Lodging, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied the Earle of <hi>Cleaveland</hi> inſtantly to Court, where finding the Duke of Buckingham in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence-chamber (the King being even then come forth to Dinner) his Lordſhip acquainted his Majeſty with our adventure, and I received preſent order to let Sir <hi>Lewes Lewkner</hi> know that he ſhould inſtantly repaire to the new come Perſian Ambaſſador, and tell him that his Audience for that afternoone was thought fit to be ſnſpended, and remitted to another day, that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty might be particularly informed of the cauſes of the diſagreement, and diſorder happened. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt blot, and fault of this adoe, was caſt upon Sir <hi>Robert Sherley</hi> for his default in his reſolution, not to returne with blows (or words at leaſt) the affront done him; which had he done, would have confirmed the truth

                  <p>The next day I brought the other Ambaſſador Sir <hi>Robert Sherley</hi> to a private Audience of his Majeſty in his Withdrawing-chamber. After many Conteſtations between the Merchants and the Ambaſſador <hi>Sherley</hi> (whether he were to be defrayed by them, as the King

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:170144:95"/>neere) gave him his eare for above halfe an houre, and diſmiſt him for his returne to London.</p>
                  <p>The two Commiſſioners from Hambrough,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>They had brought no Letters to her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, yet demanded and had Audience contrary to that when the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador of Sweden demanded, and was refuſed of Queen</hi> Ann <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had brought her no Letters.</hi>
                     </note> being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to kiſs the Queens hand (as an honour (they ſaid) which other imployd from their State before them had received of the Queen deceaſed) they requeſted me to make their way, which I did, repairing for it to her Majeſties Lord Chamberlain, but he then inſtantly gone for France, I addreſt my ſelfe to the Biſhop of Mando, and between him and Madam <hi>de</hi> Saint <hi>George</hi> (Groome of the Stoole to her Majeſty) got their Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to be aſſigned for the next day, (the thirtyeth of <hi>July</hi>) between foure and five after Veſpers. But about two that Afternoon, I was told by Sir <hi>William Gordon</hi> Gentleman Uſher to the Queen, that the King would ſpeak with me preſently about a buſineſſe of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, when repairing to his Majeſty in his Privy-Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, he commanded me that I ſhould without any noiſe, or notice to any, go inſtantly to the deputies of Hambrough, and let them know, that whereas they were aſſigned their Audience of the Queen that day, her Majeſty being ill at eaſe could not give it them till the next. I perceiving this alteration to be without her Majeſties knowledge, and for ſome particular cauſe beſt known to the King, went without further queſtion about the Service, but firſt told Sir <hi>William Gordon,</hi> that it might happen (as I gueſſed by ſome directions doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly given me by the King) that he would alter his mind, and that the Audience ſhould proceed at the houre firſt appointed for it, upon which conſideration I would go (I ſaid) to the Commiſſioners (where they then Lodged at the Still-yard, and diſcharge them of their expectation, but not ſo fully, as that I would not leave them in ſome opinion, that the Queen might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſo recover of her indiſpoſition, as to ſend to them to come to her that day: this I performed, and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in doubt, whether they ſhould go or not, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving perſwaded them to diſmiſſe their allready prepared coaches, and if they ſhould be ſent for to make their paſſage by water.

In obedience whereof I preſently taking Boat with them, and landing at the Common-Court Staires, we were there met by two of her Majeſties Gentlemen-Uſhers of her Preſence Chamber, and by them told that we ſhould not repaire to any place of repoſe (which I had aſſigned in the Chappell Cloſet on the Queens ſide) becauſe her Majeſty was already ſtaying for them in her Privy Galleries, whether going by the paſſage of the Privy Staires, they there had their acceſs, the Queen ſtanding at one ſide of the Gallery amonſt the Ladies. This ſucceeded the Eve of the day, (<hi>July</hi> 31.) that the French were removed from about the perſon of her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, the Kings Order to me <hi>(ut ſupra)</hi> relating to that important buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>The 13. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> The Ambaſſador of Denmark went in the Kings Coach (his two Coaches defrayed by his Majeſtie attending) to an Audience at None<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuch, in the Privy Chamber, there (all but the Lords of the Privy Councell excluded) he was fetcht to it from his Chamber of Repoſe (ſuch being the Kings pleaſure, though more then uſuall at a private Audience) by the Earle of Dorſet.</p>
                  <p>The 23. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> An Ambaſſador Ordinary from Venice, by name <hi>Alanſo Coutarim,</hi> (having reſided with the States of the United Provinces) arrived at Graveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end, where he was received by the Maſter of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, was welcomed from the King at his Landing at Tower-Wharffe by the Lord <hi>Willoughby,</hi>

                  <p>The 13. of <hi>September,</hi> The King having received at Theobalds the unhappy news of an Overthrow given the King of Denmark, by the Count of <hi>Tilly</hi> Generall for the Emperor, came to London, and that morning ſent

That night he returned to London, he was pleaſed to excuſe my attendance further then to my Houſe in his way at Twittenham, where he had taken me up to his Coach in his paſſage to his Audience of his Majeſty. He had demanded this acceſs to his Majeſty two or three dayes before by the King his Maſters A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, Ma. <hi>Belaw;</hi> but whether it had not been more properly carried to have gone immediatly to Court, and there in perſon to have by the Lord Chamberlaine demanded an immediate Audience (conſidering the neer relation between his Maſter and the King, and the conſequence of the newes then brought him of his Maſters defeate) was by ſome, and may be with reaſon made a <hi>Quere.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 22. of <hi>September,</hi> as I was at Supper with the Ambaſſador of Denmarke, one came to me with this meſſage, That Monſieur <hi>Quadt</hi> an Honourable Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſent Ambaſſador from the Prince of Tranſilvania, <hi>(Bethlem Gabor)</hi> being that day arrived here, had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs by Letters, both from the Prince his Maſter, and from the King of Bohemia to Monſieur <hi>Rosberf</hi> reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding here for the affaires of that King, but underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that Monſieur <hi>Rosberf</hi> was out of Town, and my ſelfe (one of the Kings Maſters of Seremonies) to be there, he deſired my adviſe, and furtherance for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding; I anſwered the Meſſenger, that my way muſt be by the Lord Chamberlaine, for his to his Majeſty, and that to that purpoſe I would repaire preſently to his
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:170144:97"/>Lordſhips approbation of my Opinion, that Monſieur <hi>Roſdroſe</hi> returne (to whom the Ambaſſador had ſuch a particular addreſs) it was unfit, and needleſs to give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of him to his Majeſty. I went to him (though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Commiſſion) and complied with him the next morning, where receiving his allowance (with thanks) for my courſe taken, and adviſe to ſtay the returning of <hi>Roſdrofe;</hi> I wrote to this Gentleman how I had procec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and ſent my Letter by his Servant. In the meane time his Majeſty having notice of the Ambaſſadors ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riveall, ſignified his pleaſure by my Lord Chamberlaine to Maſter <hi>Roſdroſe</hi> then returned, and to me, that the correſpondence between the Ambaſſador and themſelves conſidered, and anſwerable to the propoſition made by us two,
<note place="margin">Two Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors Arriving at different times, lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and defrayed in one Houſe, and at one Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> from themſelves the Prince of Tranſilvanians Ambaſſador and the King of Denmarks ſhould be lodg'd together in the ſame houſe, and dieted at the ſame Table with addition of ten pound <hi>per diem,</hi> to the others eighteen pound. The traine of the latet conſiſting but of four perſons, and that he ſhould be admitted to his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience the Tueſday following, which was performed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. I accompanying to Hampton Court with the ſervice of only two hired Coaches each with four horſes. He had allowed him by the Lord Chamberlaine one Coach with four horſes daily to attend his ſervice; but for his Majeſties profit, and with the Ambaſſadors like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I brought it to an attendance at ſuch times only as he ſhould be pleaſed the Evening before to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time I doubting, that ſome of thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects ordinarily given to Ambaſſadors at their firſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diences might be omitted, whereof (but that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felfe profeſſed to affect privacie) it was one, not to have a Titular perſon appointed to accompany him thence to the Court; I ſent a Groome of the Chamber early that morning to order what my Lord Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine had left unordered, and to have ſome Nobleman to meete and receive him there at his deſcent out of his Coach. This being incharged to the Lord Compton, he received no ſooner then at the ſecond Gate, and there
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:170144:97"/>turning up the great ſtaires through the great Hall, and Guard-chamber, the King was already under the State in the Privy-chamber expecting him, which by ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainneſſe of his approach ſo danted him, as, though he paſſed through well with his Latine Oration, he forgot to preſent his Letters of Credence, and was forced after his parting from his Majeſty to ſend them back to him with excuſe of his Servants abſence, whom he feyned to have had them about him, when he being ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly (without ſtay any where) introduced, and his Secretary left in the Preſs behind him, could not come at them opportunely to deliver them. All the time of his Audience he never covered, being not invited to it by his Majeſty, who likewiſe ſtood all that time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>
                  <p>After he had finiſhed his Oration, and that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty by me had given him a breife, but a gracious an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, I acquainted his Majeſty with his inſtant deſire, that it might ſtand with his Majeſties pleaſure to have his publick Audience made private, by commanding an avoidance of the preſſing company, or by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties retrait to his more private Lodgings, where the Ambaſſador might have an immediate acceſs to him for communication of ſome particulars of his Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which required ſpeed in diſpatch. His Majeſty was gratiouſly pleaſed to allow of the former, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding all to ſtand back but the Ambaſſador, they ſpake together a good time out of the hearing of any. After taking his leave to returne to London, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countring on the way the Duke of Buckingham, he cauſed his coach to turne back after him, but in vaine, the Duke taking another way, but overtaking the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador that night in his more ſpeedie returne, he there in the way received his Letters, his complement and his requeſt of a ſpeedy diſpatch in his buſineſſe.</p>
                  <p>The fifth of <hi>October,</hi> he had his Audience of the Queen aſſigned, and given him at Hampton Court without any Perſon of Title to receive him at the Gate, with excuſe (from the Gentleman Uſher upon my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance) of their abſence for Service of her Majeſty
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:170144:98"/>the next day in her remove. The Queen received him in her Privy-chamber, where he (after an Invitation or two of her Majeſty) covered, for which he went not away uncenſured of the obſerving Ladies, and Lords there preſent.</p>
                  <p>His Majeſty having received an account from France of the cold reception, and entertainment given his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador (Sir <hi>Dudley Carleton</hi>) Lord of Imber-court, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployd thither Extraordinary for prevention, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation of whatſoever differences that might grow from the late remove of the French from about the Perſon of the Queen; news came ſoone after to Court of the arrivall at Dover (<hi>September</hi> the foure and twentieth) of Monſieur <hi>de Baſſampierre</hi> ſent Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador from that King about the ſame buſineſſe, whom to entertain anſwerable to the ſtile, and Treatment of our Kings Ambaſſadors there, it was conſulted of and reſolved; that neither the Maſter of the Ceremonies, nor other Officers of his Majeſty ſhould be ſent to receive, &amp; ſerve him further off, then at Graveſend, &amp; a Nobleman no neerer then Greenwich for his conduction thence by water to Tower Wharffe; and to his houſe hired, and furniſhed by himſelfe in Leaden-hall-ſtreet, for which latter complement was choſen the Earle of Dorſet. On his way towards his Houſe, the Maſter of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies letting fall ſome words concerning the proviſion of Diet made for him by his Majeſties Order; he would by no meanes accept of it, anſwering, that if the King would have been pleaſed to have aſſigned him a Houſe, he would have received alſo the favour of his Diet, but to eate at an other mans charge in his own Houſe, (as he would be bold to call that hired for him by his his Officers) he deſired pardon, if he refuſed it; ſo were the Kings proviſions that had been allready ſerved in, turned back againe. For Sunday following <hi>(September</hi> the thirtieth) he had his audience aſſigned him at Hampton Court, and came thither in the Kings coach (followed by divers Noblemens) with the conduct of the Earle of Carliel (though ſome were of opinion, that
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:170144:98"/>the Earle of Dorſet ſhould have been properly his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductour, as had been one, and the ſame Perſon at the reception, and firſt audience of the Lord of Imber-court in France) he was brought after his repoſe in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell-chamber, where a Dinner had been prepared for him, but he came to late (purpoſely it was thought) to eate it, and a collation ſet ready on the Table at his comming, but remained untaſted of by him, or any of his followers) through the great Hall to the Preſence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, where both the King, and Queen ſtood under the State to receive him, the Lords, and Gentlemen ranged on the Kings right hand, the Ladies with the Dutches of <hi>Fremoville</hi> on the left. And having preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Letters to the King, and paſſed other reſpects with his Majeſty, he performed the like with the Queen, after which parting towards his coach, accompanied by the Lord mentioned, and others, he was in the outward Court told that the Duke of Buckingham was comming after him, whereat making a ſtand till the Duke came, they two privatly and apart from the reſt, diſcourſed halfe an houre together before they parted, the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador diſmiſſing the Kings Coach, returned in his owne to London.</p>
                  <p>The twentieth of <hi>October,</hi> a Signification from the Lords of the Councell came to the Ambaſſadors of Denmarke, and of <hi>Betblem Gabor</hi> (as alſo to Monſieur <hi>Benica,</hi> Agent ſent hither from the Marqueſs of <hi>Baden</hi>) that if they would be pleaſed to come to Monſieur <hi>Roſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorſs,</hi> reſident here for the King of Bohemia) at his Lodging neere White-Hall (which they could not but think (as they did) a bold Invitation for perſons of their quality) they ſhould have word ſent them thither of the time of the Lords readineſſe to receive, and heare them; but when they were all there at the houre aſſigned, one of the Clerks of the Councell brought word, that <hi>Bethlem Gabors</hi> Ambaſſador and the Envoy from the Marqueſs of <hi>Baden,</hi> were to have preſent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, but that for the Ambaſſador of Denmark, their Lordſhips deſired his patience till ſome other time,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:170144:99"/>which he (not without ſhew of reſentment for ſuch an Excluſion) ſaying, the other two were by me introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced (firſt the Miniſter of <hi>Bethlem Gabor,</hi> and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly after his diſpatch, the other.)</p>
                  <p>The two and twentieth of <hi>October,</hi> the Ambaſſador of Denmark had acceſs to the King in his Withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-chamber with my conduct, and upon his diſpatch, I demanded pardon if I gave him not my attendance home, becauſe of a charge I had (I ſaid) inſtantly tofetch the two Commiſſioners of Hambrough to their parting Audience: ſo repaired to them, where (as I had already ordered it) they ſtayed my comming at my Houſe (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving before ſent them to their Lodgings a Noblemans coach for their tranſport thither) I brought them by the way of the Parke, and Privy Galleries (anſwerable to the ſtile of their firſt introduction in quality of depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, not Ambaſſadors) into the Withdrawing-chamber, there thanking his Majeſty for his favours, and deſiring ſome ſmall addition, and cleering to and of their River of Elb, blocked up by his Majeſties Ships (their other demand of tranſport of Corne, Copper, and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition of War <hi>(ut ſupra)</hi> being with reaſon denied them) they took their leave, and two dayes after had their preſents of two Gold Chaines (each of the valew of 210 <hi>l.</hi> brought them by two of the under Officers of the Jewell-houſe) who had for their gratuity given them by the hand of one of the Commiſſioners ten peeces, and to their Servants twenty ſhillings. Two dayes after inviting me to dine with them, they before Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner preſented me with a purſe, and fifty peeces. Soone after taking their Journey to Dover (without my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, or expectation of it) they there imbarqued for France to returne by Paris, Bruxells, the Hague, and Hambourgh.</p>
                  <p>The Ambaſſador of Denmark had the fifth of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> a private Audience of his Majeſty in the Withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-chamber, and was after it by me conducted over the Terras croſſe the lower end of the Guard-chamber to the Queens Cloſet in her Privy-chamber for the like Audience of her Majeſty to ſignifie the King his Maſters
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:170144:99"/>pleaſure of imploying him on a poſting Journey into France, with intention and command of his ſpeedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne hither. But foure or five dayes after, as he was upon the inſtant of his departure, Letters came from his King, which for a while retarded him till others comming; he the ſixteenth of <hi>November</hi> wrote to me to procure him another Audience of his Majeſty (with all poſſible ſpeed, (allwayes (regarding (he ſaid) his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties convenience.) This in abſence of my Lord Chamberlain I moved for, and obtained within two hours after, he comming to Court by water, the Kings Coachman being not to be found for his ſo immediate Service.</p>
                  <p>The eighteenth of <hi>November</hi> (after he had the day before prepared for his ſilent departure) he in the morning early went in a Barge (of his own hiring) to Graveſend, and by coach alſo (at his own coſt) to Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, leaving behind him ſome murmurs of the Kings Servants, that having done him the Service of their places, expected their ſatisfaction, and would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive, but that they ſhould be deceived of it, he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſo ſuddainly without notice given, or leave taking (except ſome few dayes before of the King, Queen, and certaine Lords) though his intention of his ſpeedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne were not undiſcovered to ſome beſides my ſelfe, whom he truſted with it.) The day of his departure Monſieur <hi>Bonika</hi> (ſent from the Marqueſſe of <hi>Baden</hi> about important buſineſſe) having taken leave, and received for his preſent a Chaine of Gold of 150 <hi>l.</hi> valew, poſted after for his company, and ſafer paſſage to Paris.</p>
                  <p>On Sunday the fifteenth of <hi>November,</hi> the Duke of Buckingham having prepared a ſumptuous entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Supper and a Maske at York-houſe for the French Ambaſſador Monſieur <hi>Baſſampierre,</hi> had his Feaſt honored with the Preſence of both their Majeſties, the King ſitting towards the end of the Table with the Queen at his right hand, the Ambaſſador was (as ſoone as they were ſet) invited by his Majeſty to ſit downe at the end of the Table on that hand which might ſeeme to be the upper end, but was held the lower,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:170144:100"/>becauſe next the doore, and furtheſt from the fire he had a wet Towell to waſh, which given him by the Duke, who ſtood by to ſerve him all the time of the Supper, and would not be put from him, nothwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Ambaſſadors many excuſing refuſall of ſuch ſervice &amp;c. the Ladies, and ſtrangers invited had a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull ſupper in the great Hall of the Houſe, while the King, and Queen were retyred during ſome preparations for the Maske in that Roome, where their Majeſties were Feaſted, who that night lodged at Somerſet-Houſe, and had the next day a continuance of their, and the Ambaſſadors entertainment of Feaſting, Dancing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſixteenth of November, the Queen prepared for him a Maske, repreſented by the Duke of Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, the Earle of Holland, Sir <hi>George Goring</hi> (her Viz-Chamberlain) and other her Majeſties Servants, at Somerſet-houſe, whereto he came from White-Hall in company of their Majeſties by water, and had made for him after the Maske, a moſt ſumptuous Banquet. He ſhould have had (by aſſignation) his publick parting Audience, but the King (with an intreating complement of letting him know, and leaving it to his conſideration how ſeriouſly the Queen was at that time applying her ſelf to her Masking buſineſſe) drew him to have it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred till the Sunday following, when towards foure of the clock, the Earle of Carliel (with the Kings beſt coach and another of his Majeſties) fourteen of the Lords Coaches following (ſix or ſeaven of the Kings Servants onely in them to leave the more place for ſtrangers) brought him for his repoſe to the Councell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber (where Wine, Bread, Beere &amp;c. uſually ſerved in by the Guard, was for that time ſpared, as a cuſtome of improper uſe towards the French) and from thence over the Terras to the Banquetting-houſe, where both their Majeſties ſtanding ready to receive him, and the Ladies ranged in order of their qualities on the left hand of the King all along the Roome, and the Lords and Gentlemen on the right (The French that marched before the Ambaſſador being made to ſtay, and be placed

                  <p>Two dayes before his departure, it being talked of in Court, that the Maſter of the Jewell-Houſe, Sir <hi>Henry Mildmay</hi> had made his meanes to the Duke of Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham, and other neere about the Kings perſon for carriage, and delivery of the Preſent deſigned to the Ambaſſador (which was a rich Jewell of foure great Diamonds, with a great Pearle pendant at it, alltoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eſteemed by Jewellers (at a Merchants rate) to be worth ſeaven thouſand pounds) the Maſter of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, underſtanding of theſe endeavours to the others profit, and his diſadvantage both preſent, and future from preſident, came to my houſe (as to one whom it highly concerned) he ſaid) in my right of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion after his death, or in caſe of his ſickneſſe, or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, when I was to carry the like Preſents to thoſe Ambaſſadors that I had attended, or done Service, to whom they ſhould be formerly preſented) with Jewels from his Majeſty) and intreated me to go with him to the Lord Chamberlain (the Earle of Montgomery.) To whom when we came, his Lordſhip upon the firſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the difference reſolved it to be an undue claime of the Maſter of the Jewell-houſe, and profeſſed he would to his power oppoſe him. From his Lordſhip, we went both together to the Earle of Pembrok (then Lord Steward of his Majeſties Houſe-hold, and but a ſmall time before Lord Chamberlain) and he (with expreſſion even of paſſion) condemned the pretence of the Maſter of the Jewell-Houſe, ſaying, no man
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:170144:101"/>could better ſpeake to that queſtion, then he could, who had been preſent when it was moved before the Lords of the Councell, and King <hi>James</hi> himſelfe for their deciſion,

This queſtion thus far cleered, Sir <hi>Henry Mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may</hi> nevertheleſſe deſiſted not to make freinds under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand for maintainance of his Claime, till the day, and almoſt houre that the Jewell was to be preſented, when the Duke of Buckingham (that had ſeemed before to favour him) came about for the Maſter of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and declared his opinion for him, ſo as the Earle of Carliel (who had in the interim the Jewell commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the King to his cuſtody) after he had alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his ſentence the ſame way) delivered it to the hands of the Maſter of the Ceremonies, by whom it was that Evening preſented to the Ambaſſador, and who the nex day received in gratuity for it, and for his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and paines taken in this Ambaſſadors ſervice, three hundred peeces; immediatly after he had preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, he entering the Kings Withdrawing-chamber to give account to his Majeſty how thankfully it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, I then ſtanding at the door, heard his Majeſty ſay (when Sir <hi>Lewes</hi> thankt him for his moſt gracious favor in committing it to his carriage) that it was the Maſter of the Ceremonies right, and none other to carry, and preſent Jewels to Ambaſſadors. The day of the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors departure (<hi>November</hi> the fifteenth) when he was reſolved already, and the Kings Barge with two other appointed for his tranſport to Graveſend (the Tide fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling late, and the wind proving high, and contrary, he
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:170144:101"/>had Coaches hired for him (at his own charge) and with them and his own coaches went thither by Land, the Maſter of the Ceremonies accompanying him ſo far but no further, anſwerable to the new Order for conduct of Ambaſſadors. The Marſhall of the Ceremonies <hi>(Walter Briſco)</hi> only appointed for his ſervice on the way for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as there might be neceſſary uſe of it, till he ſhould be imbarqued at Dover &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The Ambaſſador of <hi>Bethlem Gabor,</hi> Prince of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilvania, having received a full ſatisfaction of his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as the condition of our affaires would permit, and his Preſent of a thouſand ounces of guilt Plate brought him by the Maſter of the Jewell Houſe, and two of his Officers with him, rewarding theſe, he reſerved the gratuitie that might be expected from him by the other to time and conſideration. In the meane time I having been ſought to by a Gentleman, (the Ambaſſadors only follower qualified as fit to ſit with him at the Table) to procure him alſo a Preſent as to the Ambaſſadors Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary; I told him I doubted of good ſucceſs in that ſuite, in regard not only of the preſent neceſſitous condition of the time, but alſo becauſe he had not at any time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the Negotiation between his Maſter, and the Lords, which having kept him from notice of his merit, would prove, I thought, a reaſon for his excluſion, as indeed it did, when acquainting my Lord Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine with his ayme, his Lordſhip gave him a negative Anſwer to that purpoſe, wherewith I quieted him.</p>
                  <p>The day after the Ambaſſador had received his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, recommending the demand of his parting Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence (not yet formally given him; to the Vicechamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine (the Lord <hi>Carleton</hi>) (in abſence of the Lord Chamberlaine, then ill at eaſe) and his Lordſhip de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding it in my hearing, I propounded the fitneſs of his having it given in the Preſence Chamber (as being his laſt Audience) therefore requiſite to be in publique, as the firſt Audience had been at Hampton Court; but was anſwered by the King, that he took him to be no man that would ſtand upon point of Ceremony, ſo would have it (he ſaid) in his Withdrawing-Chamber,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:170144:102" rendition="simple:additions"/>and me to introduce him by the way of the Parke, which obeying, I brought him after Dinner with the Service of two hired coaches (the Kings beings excuſed by him, when I offered it, becauſe he had not had it (he ſaid) at his firſt Audience) he was received by no other No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman then the Lord Vice-chamberlaine at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the Privy Gallery, and by him brought to the King in his Withdrawing-Chamber, whence I after conducted him to the Queen for the like Audience of her Majeſtie; but receiving notice, that ſhe was even then gone to Somerſet-Houſe to her veſpers, and would returne for that Ambaſſadors occaſion, he likewiſe went to his Lodging, and ſtayed there, till the Queen repaſſing before his door, he followed her to White-Hall, and had in her Majeſties Privy Chamber Audience, and diſmiſſion. This paſſed, I accompanied him to the Duke of Buckingham for his farewell, but the Duke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then abſent, and I going in his Search to the Privy Galleries, found there his Majeſtie ſitting all alone, when (after demand of pardon for my entrance ſo at un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares to his Preſence) I made uſe of the opportunity to tell his Majeſty what had not an hour before paſſed between me, and the Ambaſſador upon a queſtion mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Sir <hi>Maurice Dromond</hi> Gentleman-Uſher to the Queen immediatly before his Audience; which queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (he ſaid) had been then in his hearing moved by the Queene to the King, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether the Ambaſſador would or not cover in her Preſence, and that the King was of opinion he would not cover; I anſwered the Gentleman that I would not reſolve him for the future, but that for the time paſſed, I knew (I ſaid) he had co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered at his firſt Audience after the Queen had once or twice invited him to it. But for better reſolution of this doubt (I further told his Majeſtie with this oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity) I had a little before his ſaid Audience asked the Ambaſſador (as with the pretence of my own ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, who had not (I ſaid to him) ſufficiently obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him in that point) whether he had at his fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:170144:102" rendition="simple:additions"/>was, No, I will not now cover, though I did at firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (ſaid he) I ſhall now appeare before her Majeſty as comming of my own Errand, only to take my leave, having no particular Order for it from the Prince my Maſter; but when I came firſt to her Majeſties preſence, I ſpeak to her my Maſters words, by my Maſters com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and ſo thought fit upon her Majeſties Invitation to cover, which now I will not do, though I ſhould be invited to it, as having nothing to ſay to her from any but my ſelf, and this only tending to the leave I am to take of her Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>Having reported this unto the King, and finding him to approve of the Ambaſſadors reaſons, as civill; I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded further to intimate to his Majeſty, That I had obſerved both at this Ambaſſadors firſt and laſt Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that his Majeſty was pleaſed to ſtand bare-headed all that time, as if he would not have him to cover in his Preſence, either from his Example or Invitation; the King anſwered, that I had well obſerved, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it, and that he had purpoſely kept off his own hat, leaſt the other might have put on his, which for ſome conſiderations he was not yet ſatisfied to be convenient &amp;c. During the time of this Ambaſſadors ſtay here, there paſſed no viſite, or other correſpondence between him and the Venetian, both of them pretending to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedence, and not appearing upon the title to be mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given of Excellenza, or becauſe the latter ſtood upon it, that he was not viſite firſt, though the other came laſt, being a Repreſentant of a State that pretended to a parity with crowned Heads. The fourth of <hi>December,</hi> he took Barge at the Savoy Staires without any conduct (though offered) perhaps irregularly being no Kings Ambaſſador) and went that night to Graveſend for his further Journey. The night before his departure, (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many complementall Excuſes of the length of his Journey, and ſhortneſs of his proviſions for it) he preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me with a Purſe, and in it thirty peeces. He gave to the maſter of the Jewell-Houſe two dayes before a chain of fifteene pound value, which was received but coldly, as a gratuity beneath expectation, and not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to his quality.</p>

                  <p>There being a Maske in practice of the Queen in perſon, with other great Ladies for the end of Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, I three or foure dayes before Twelftide, asked my Lord Chamberlain what courſe would be taken with the Ambaſſadors here reſident, <hi>Contareni</hi> for Venice, and <hi>Joachimi</hi> for the States? he anſwered, that the King had already ſignified his pleaſure, that if they would come, they ſhould be wellcome, and have places apart provided for them, but that his Majeſty was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved never more to admit any Ambaſſadors reſident to ſit next his perſon under the State, no more then to eate with him in publick; I replyed, that I thought this change in his Majeſty from his Fathers manner; would draw ſome Puntillious exception, or <hi>Cavill</hi> from the Venetian, unleſſe it were ſeaſonably and heedfully car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, which to prevent, it would not be (I thought) amiſs for his Lordſhip to ſend to the Maſter of the Ceremonies for uſe of his experience, which referred to me, I wrote to him about it, that morning he came to Court, and thence after conference with my Lord went to both thoſe Ambaſſadors, the Venetian, and the States. This made no queſtion of his comming nor pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, other then as the King ſhould command (onely (he ſaid) that if the Venetian ſhould refuſe to come, he ſhould perhaps doubt, whether it would be fit for him to be there alone, as (out of a kind of Singularity) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the others abſence by his Preſence.</p>
                  <p>The Venetian deſired time for conſideration, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, it being a Novelty, and a leſſening to him (he ſaid) of the honour affoarded to his predeceſſour; but in the meane time he prevayled ſo by his reaſons (how heavily it might follow him in the Judgement, and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his Republick, when he ſhould be the firſt of his Predeceſſours that ever ſuffered by ſuch an excluſion, and had as yet ſince his imployent here never received pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick honour from his Majeſty &amp;c.) as that the King was pleaſed to let him know by my Lord Chamberlain (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally repairing to him under pretence of returning his viſit) that he ſhould for this once have the reſpects of being ſeated next his Majeſty in manner as his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:170144:103"/>had been before him, and with him the States Ambaſſador, whom alſo my Lord Chamberlain had then viſited with the ſame ſignification, but that neither he, nor any other Ambaſſador were ever to expect the like hereafter, and that to confirm, and intimate the Kings reſolution in this point, he (as alſo the other) ſhould do well to give account of it to his State (leaſt other of their Miniſters might hereafter pretend, or think to obtain the like honour with importunity) and further to take notice, that if the King ſhould make another Maske at Candlemas, he muſt be content with a place to be aſſigned him apart (and not next the chair of State) if he would be preſent at it) with which plaine intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he ſeemed to hold himſelfe ſatisfied, and the Mone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day ſeaven night after following after Twelfday, he and the States Ambaſſador were aſſigned their <hi>Rendez-vous</hi> at the great Gate of the Court at ſix in the Evening, and with them the States Ambaſſadors Wife, and Daughters with limitation of as few followers as might be, and thoſe of the better ſort. The place for their repoſe was the Councell-chamber, whence they were conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (firſt the Ladies to a Box reſerved for them at the upper end of the Banquetting-houſe on the Kings right hand) and next their followers to a Scaffold over, and behind his Majeſty, then the Ambaſſadors themſelves to the Preſence of the King in the Privy-Galleries, and after with his Majeſty to the Maske; the Venetian was ſeated on the right hand, the States Ambaſſador on the left of his Majeſty. I underſtood after that the States Ambaſſadors Lady, and her Daughters took exceptions againſt their being thruſt up in a corner without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. To which I anſwered, that I had brought the Ambaſſatrice a liberty of election from my Lord Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain whether ſhe would be pleaſed to ſit amongſt the great Ladies or apart, and ſhe had choſen to ſit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part with her own company, becauſe (ſhe ſaid) ſhe wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Language, ſo the fault was hers, not mine, if ſhe were unſatisfied.</p>

Two dayes after I received from my Lord Chamberlain this direction, that I ſhould intimate to the States Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador and to the deputy newly arrived, that whereas they had deſired an acceſſe to the Duke of Buckingham, for an enterance to their buſineſſe in hand, and that my Lord Duke judged it not ſo proper to give them one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Audience of his Majeſty, they ſhould be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to thinke, and reſolve of a time for the Latter, which if they would demand for that day, or the next, he doubted not, but they ſhould have it, the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Majeſty was to returne (from whence he came but the day before) to Theobalds, and would not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine at London till Thursday following. That in the meane time their firſt Audience being paſt, they might Negotiate with the Commiſſioners appointed for the further proſecution of their buſineſſe.

                  <p>To this it was anſwered by my Lord <hi>Carelton</hi> (Vice-chamberlain) that he then knew the Miniſter new come to be qualified no otherwiſe then for a deputy, though a joynct Commiſſioner with the other, and that he could not, nor (he thought) would expect other Treatment then under that Title; with this intimation I repaired to them, and after delivery of my meſſage (with a touch to he laſt purpoſe) I had for anſwer their deſire of an Audience the next day, which they had of his Majeſty in the great Gallery of Somerſet Houſe the twelth of <hi>March</hi> by ten in the morning (the Queen being then in her Houſe retyred, or not yet riſen.)

To which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for excuſe, I compleyed with him from the Lord Chamberlain, that he would be pleaſed to have pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for his ill accommodation, till the Officers of the Ward-robe might ſet up his Bedd, and directions be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for his Service and attendance as before; this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, the next day he began again upon the Kings diet and charge, having of his Train by liſt two and twenty perſons.

To the firſt I conducted him (without company of a Lord, or other then his own followers) this being not publick (though the firſt Audience after his return) from the Court gate by the Staire that aſcends to the Sone-table chamber (the way accuſtomed through the Park and Tiltyard Gallery being reſtrained by the King, pleaſure for his more privacy there) and repoſing himſelfe in the next Roome to that Chamber, was called forth to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty in his Withdrawing-chamber, and had there his Audience. After paſſing through the Councell-chamber over the Terras by the lower end of the Guard-chamber
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:170144:105"/>to the Chappell Cloſet on the Kings ſide, he was met at the Preſence doore by Sir <hi>George Goring</hi> (the Queens Vice-chamberlain) and brought to her Preſence in her Privy-chamber.

                  <p>Before he came to the Preſence of the King, I asked him if he deſired his Gentlemen ſhould kiſs his Majeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies hands? he anſwered, in no ſort, becauſe (quoth he) I would not have notice taken of my new train, as if I were a new come Ambaſſadour; and for their kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Kings hand, they may do it at my departure.

                  <p>The fourteenth of <hi>June</hi> I had word of two Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſioners (ſtyled by them who brought newes of them Ambaſſadors) arrived in the road of the Cowes from Saly in Barbary, for my better information whereof I went the day following to Court, and had order for my repaire to them, but not as with an honour to them of being ſent for their reception before or at their landing, but to diſcover what I could of the ſcope of their Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, and to let them know his Majeſty had taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of their arrivall, and proceeding to London, they ſhould there at his returne, have a fitting time appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for their Audience; but when I came to the Cowes they were parted thence to Southampton, whether fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing them, I there performed my charge (finding the ſubſtance of their Negotiation to be a ſuit for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties protection and confederation with them againſt the Spaniard, who had expelled them Spaine) and the next day returned to Portſmouth.</p>
                  <p>About ten dayes before the King went to Portſmouth, there came to London from France a Count of Emden (ſecond Brother to the cheife of that title, and Family) after whom his Majeſty commanding my inquiry, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he were of the Imperiall party, I found him not ſuch, and to be come hither onely for ſight of England, and of his Majeſty, pretending (as I was told) that he
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:170144:111"/>deſired to live here unnoted till he might receive his Horſes and Apparrel left in <hi>France</hi> for his better ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor at Court; but the King going his journey before thoſe came, he (while I was at <hi>Portſmouth</hi>) came thither, and not addreſſing himſelfe to me for his Introduction to the King, took an uncertain way by another Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who leaving him alone (when he came to Court walking in a place unbeſitting for him) I offered him my ſervice, gave his Majeſty notice of him, and had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for his acceſſe. After which he immediatly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further Ceremony took his leave, and dining at the Lord Stewards, and Lord Chamberlains Table (joyned) in company of the Duke, and Monſieur <hi>de Soubize,</hi> he after returned to Portſmouth with a Warrant that I at his requeſt obtained for him of the Duke, for tranſport of ſix Geldings, and two ſtone Horſes, for which Warrant he ſuppoſing (becauſe I in abſence of the Dukes Secretary drew it) that it had been a part of my Office, in which (till then) I had not ſerved him) preſented me by one of his Gentlemen with five peeces, which I excuſing to receive, my Servant after accepted of as for his own, and to that end in termes of ſuch expreſſion given him.</p>
                  <p>An houre before his imbarking, his Steward preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me from him (as too ſmall an acknowledgment (he ſaid) for my great paines) with twenty peeces. I gave the hoſt of his Houſe for his own Bed, and Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber (as paid) by the King (for which and for the reſt I was after to paſs my account) twenty ſhillings and for foure or five Beds more in his Houſe, the like, not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering by this the gratification whatſoever that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Soubize</hi> ſhould think fit to beſtow on him. The proportion I held of payment for Beds for his followers Billetted in the Towne, was after two ſhillings the week a ſtanding Bed, and fifteen pence a Trundle-bed increaſing this ſomm to ſome, as their good, and kind treatment of ſtrangers deſerved it.</p>
                  <p>The ſeven and twentieth of <hi>June,</hi> the two Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſioners from <hi>Saley</hi> had their firſt Audience of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:170144:111"/>at White-hall upon a removing day, which ſerved me for excuſe of the ſmall appearance then at Court, and of their not ſeeing the King under the State in the Preſence-chamber at their firſt acceſs, though being but Repreſentants of a newly formed Republick, and no Chriſtians, they had no more reaſon to expect, then to have that honour to be done them. I conducted them from their Lodging in Fleet-ſtreet to the Common Stayres at White-Hall in one of the Kings Barges, and thence to their Audience in the Privy Gallery, whence his Majeſty for further knowledge, and debatement of their buſineſſe, remitted them to his Councell.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>July</hi> the eigh, The Ambaſſador Reſident for the States of the United Provinces, and their Deputies for the Eaſt-Indian buſneſſe, and for accommodation of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences grown lately at Sea, parting from London to Lodge at Colebrook, were early at Windſore, dined with my Lord <hi>Conway</hi> principall Secretary, had their Audience in the Afternoon in the Withdrawing-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, went that night to Kingſton, and the next day to London.</p>
                  <p>The tenth of <hi>July</hi> the Deputy being upon his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I inquired of the Ambaſſador what might be the diſpoſition of the ſaid Deputy touching his Preſent from his Majeſtie, whether to receive it in Plate, or in a gold chaine, and found him indifferent, yet intimating with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that if his Majeſtie would be pleaſed to Knight him, it would make the Preſent (whatſoever) more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. This made knowne by me to my Lord Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine, and by his Lordſhip to the King, he was that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon dignified. Sir <hi>Jame Catz,</hi> and (after he and ſeven or eigh more attended the diſpatch of ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining part of his buſineſſe) he departed for Graveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end, and thence for Holland <hi>July</hi> the twentieth having the day before preſented me with five and twenty pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but leaving the preſent ordained him for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of 500. Ounces of gilt plate (allready prepared but reſerved in the Goldſmiths hand, <hi>&amp; pour cauſe</hi>) to be ſent after him, as it was (being couſened for him by
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:170144:112"/>the under Officers of the Jewell Houſe to Monſieur <hi>Joachimi</hi>) two months after, the Bringer receiving from him the gratuity of ſix peeces.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of Buckingham, being ready for his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition to <hi>Retz,</hi> and ſollicited by his Servant Maſter <hi>Fotherley</hi> for his Signature to the Warrants, (annually beſtowed on Ordinary Ambaſſadors and Agents) for Veniſon, his Majeſty appointed the Earle of Dorſet for Juſtice in Eyre during the Dukes abſence, ſo the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants being by him aſſigned, and I ſending for them to Maſter <hi>Fotherley,</hi> received from him (not a refuſall) a queſtion, Whether it were not a part of his charge, and a due for him to deliver them to the Ambaſſadors; But this queſtion ſoon reſolved (from preſidents of Sir <hi>Lewes Lewkner</hi>) I had them and delivered them, <hi>viz.</hi> To the Ambaſſador of Venice three (whereof one he beſtowed on me, as a right (he ſaid) of my charge,) to the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador of the States three, (whereof one was returned to me; to the King of Denmarks Agent two, whereof one came to me, and to the King of Bohemias Agent two.</p>
                  <p>The ſixth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> while I was retyred to my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try home at Twittenham, I had notice given me, that the Marqueſſe <hi>Pompeio Strozzi,</hi> Ambaſſador Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary from the Duke of <hi>Mantova,</hi> was arrived at London with ten of his company, whereof the Count <hi>di ſon Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo Nicolo Delfino</hi> a Gentleman of Venice, and <hi>Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meo Amaltheo</hi> his Steward, were received as men of quality.</p>
                  <p>This Ambaſſador having in his way negotiated with the French King, came hither for condolement of the Duke his Maſter (who dyed above five moneths before) and for congratulation of the other Duke (his Brothers ſucceſſion to that Dukedome.) After I had (of my ſelfe with reſpect to his quality viſited him) and drawn from him by diſcourſe ſomething of his ends &amp;c. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to my Lord Chamberlaine, then at his Houſe at Endfield) and from him (as I had directions) to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie then at Winſore, having before diſpatched this my Officer with Letters to my Lord Chamberlaine.
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:170144:112"/>But theſe comming in his Lordſhips abſence, were ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and preſented by his Secretary to the Earle of Holland, and by him to the King, who in anſwer of their contents paſſed his reſolution to be ſignified by me to my Lord Chamberlaine, That the Ambaſſador ſhould have his publique Audience at Winſore on Sunday fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, but not to have his Diet defrayed (no more then any other Ambaſſador ſhould from thence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards) nor have any coaches provided for them at his Majeſties charge, Except at times of publique Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>
                  <p>I, after this ſpeaking with his Majeſtie (for my bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter warrant concerning this new Order, had a confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his pleaſure to that purpoſe, and propounding only how fit, and acceptable it might be for the ſaid Ambaſſador if (in correſpondence of the treatment, which I underſtood he had received in France) he might have a dinner provided for him in Court the day of his firſt Audience) it was aſſented to, and his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties pleaſure for it, intimated by me to the Lord Steward of the Houſhold (the Earle of Pembroke.) Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter returning to London, I let this Ambaſſador know his Majeſties reſolution taken for no more defraying of Ambaſſadors either diet or coaches; whereat he taking no exceptions, provided himſelfe of two Coaches with ſix Horſes each, with which and with the Kings (ſent thither from Windſore for carriage of his own perſon) he went the eleaventh of <hi>Auguſt</hi> to Bed to Staines, and receiving there the next morning his Majeſties well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the Earle of Cleaveland, was by his Lordſhip (with the attendance of foure or five Gentlemen of the Privy-chamber in the Kings, and the Lord <hi>Conways</hi> coach) conducted to Windſore, and found there prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and fairly hanged three Lodgings of the Earle of Worceſters, and a Table ready covered for his dinner (anſwerable to what I had propounded to his Majeſty and the Lord Steward for avoidance of a greater charge from continuall defraying) and for the Ambaſſadors more eaſie digeſtion of the new order, eſtabliſhed to that frugall purpoſe. He had at Dinner the Service of
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:170144:113"/>the Kings Officers, and Guard, and the company (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides of the Earle of Cleaveland) of the Lord <hi>de la Ware</hi> and of ſeaven or eight Gentlemen, the Kings Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</p>
                  <p>I immediatly after dinner repairing to the King for knowledge of his pleaſure for the inſtant of his Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, was by his Majeſty called apart, and asked whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he muſt not invite him to cover? (I excuſing my my definite reſolution) anſwered that I had by diſcourſe already drawn from him, that at his Audience of the French King (then ſick in Bed) he had been called by him to his Bed-ſide, and made to ſit downe, and cover. But (replyed the King) I know that the King of Spain doth not allow the Duke of Mantova's Ambaſſador to be covered in his preſence. Sir, quoth I, That may be an effect of the ſupercilious and affected greatneſſe of that King beyond others, in conformity whereof I am told by this Ambaſſador, that while he was at <hi>Paris,</hi> neither of the two Spaniſh Miniſters (Ordinary nor Extraordinary) vouchſafed him a viſite, and that he in returne thereof, never looked after them. Well, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed his Majeſty, then I know what to doe, bring him to me; with that his Majeſty entring the Preſence Chamber, ſtayed there under the State the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors comming, and the diſcharge of his complement, which was briefe, onely expreſſing the reſpects of his Maſter in the account he had command to give his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of his Aſſumption to his Principality by the death of his Brother: How much the Duke his Maſter ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored the King, what honour he himſelfe had by that imployment &amp;c. The King before he ſpake, having made him an invitation (which he took) to cover. This fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed, he returned to his Chamber, the Earle of Cleave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land reconducting him thither, but refuſing to paſs fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with him in the Kings coach on any part of the way, he was to goe, as not ſuiting (his Lordſhip ſaid) with his quality, of which opinion was my Lord Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain producing for example Monſieur <hi>de Baſſampierre</hi> who had the uſe (he ſaid) of the Kings coach to his firſt Audience from London to Hampton Court, but that
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:170144:113"/>diſmiſſed there, he returned in his own coach to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and had not the Earles company back that brought him thither. The like both for Lord, and coach was here obſerved, and the Ambaſſador left to proceed on his way (with his own coaches and company) towards the Queen then remaining at Wellingbourn to drink thoſe waters. We went that night to Ammerſham, there in conference, I acquainted him with ſomething touching the Kings queſtion to me of his covering, which queſtion (he ſaid) he hoped his Majeſty did not move as making doubt of his Maſters right in thoſe points of reſpect, but to ſee how I could reſolve him, becauſe (ſaid he) it is well known to all, that he goeth not leſſe in reſpects given him by all Kings, and Princes, then the great Duke of Tuſcany, and the Duke of Savoy, whoſe Ambaſſadors cover (and ſo doth (ſaid he) the Duke his Maſters Ambaſſadors) in Preſence of the Pope, the Emperour, and the King of France, of all whoſe Miniſters when they are imployed to him, he taketh the hand in his own Houſe, and elſewhere, he onely giving them viſits at their Lodgings, <hi>ſed in hoc Quaere.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From Ammerſham, we went through Alesbury to Stony-Stratford, to dinner, and to Bed to Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. Thence I inſtantly diſpatcht my Officer with Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the Queens Vice-Chamberlain Sir <hi>Geoge Goring</hi> and to the Earle of Carliel to procure an Audience the next day. To which the Earle returned anſwer by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (the Vice-Chamberlain being abſent) and aſſured me of the Queens eſpeciall content for the Ambaſſadors arrivall there, and that ſhe would give him an Audience and a dinner the next day at Wellingbourn ſeven miles from Northampton, from which he was fetched by the Lord <hi>Percy,</hi> and foure of her Majeſties Gentlemen of the beſt quality in two of her Coaches and one Lords, was entertained at dinner by the Earle of Carliel in his Lodgings (but at the Queens charge) without the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed Court confuſion (unavoidable where the Kings Servants, eſpecially thoſe of the Guard give their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance) and waited on onely by the Kings Servants, and accompanied by the Counteſſe of Oxford, and three
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:170144:114"/>of the Queenes Maides of honour. After dinner he was conducted by the Lord <hi>Percy</hi> (in other two of the Queens Coaches for the more honour by that Variety) to the place, where her Majeſties Tent was planted neere the Wells, and was there at the Tent doore met, and introduced by the Earle of Carliel to her Majeſtyes Preſence (her muſickke with voices diſpoſed in an inner Roome of intent of entertaining him at his enterance) had there a moſt gratious Audience, delivered his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and complement in words little different from thoſe he had uſed to the King; and (having taken his leave, but after making a ſhort returne with excuſe of his deſire to hear the Muſick) which he did for almoſt halfe an hours ſpace in company of her Majeſty (both of them all the while ſtanding) he with exceeding ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for ſo much honour received, returned (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conducted by the Lord <hi>Percy</hi> in the ſame coaches) to Northampton. The next day, we went to Dinner to Stony Stratford, to Bed to Dunſtable, and the ſixteenth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> to London, where at the inſtant of our Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall we were told of two Ambaſſadors Commiſſioners come from the King of Denmarke to his Majeſty. This made the Ambaſſador (anſwerable to ſome diſcourſe paſſed between him and me to that purpoſe) fall to queſtion me in what manner I thought ſhould be their Treatment, whether with or without defraying? to which I returning no direct anſwer (as holding it unfit for me definitly to reſolve what would be his Majeſties pleaſure) he put me in mind of what I had told him to that purpoſe at his firſt comming, <hi>viz.</hi> That the King would no more defray Ambaſſadors Dyet, Lodging or coaches (having begun already with Monſieur de <hi>Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſampierre.</hi> Now (added he) if the Ambaſſadors of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke, or the Duke of Savoys (voiced to be on the way comming hither (to whom (he ſaid) he held himſelfe being the Duke of <hi>Mantovan's</hi> Repreſentant, equall in all conditions) ſhould receive thoſe reſpects beyond him, he could not but in his Maſters behalfe reſent it, who (not to reckon it (he ſaid) as a merit, and to challenge from thence the Kings better reſpects) had ſent to his
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:170144:114"/>Majeſty a perſon (himſelf) of as eminent quality (he might, he ſaid, boldly without arrogancy ſay it) as any of his Court) to give his Majeſty an account of the late Dukes death, and of the Aſſumption of this now li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to his Principality (without regard what the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard thought, or would think, or do againſt it) before he had ever heard, or looked to hear from <hi>England,</hi> for complement of condoling, or congratulating: Wheras the Emperor, the king of <hi>France,</hi> and the Arch-Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches had already by way of prevention ſent to his Maſter perſons of eminent condition, to condole and congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, who had been lodged in his Maſters Court,

                        <hi>Viz. After that of</hi> Monſieur de Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſampierre.</note> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayed (as he was moſt aſſured) that any Ambaſſador ſhould be whom the king of <hi>England</hi> ſhould pleaſe to ſend (in return of his imployment) to the Duke his Maſter, howſoever it had been his fortune to be made a ſecond Preſident for that courſe of not defraying, new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken in this Court, and to be obſerved hereafter (anſwerable to the intimation he had received by my mouth from his Majeſty: Which (as it was, he ſaid, a liberty that ſuch great kings might take in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Eminency above other inferiour Princes (as the king of <hi>France</hi> had likewiſe already began and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) yet for his Majeſty to eſtabliſh an Order, and after to break it (eſpecially while he himſelf ſhould be here a Witneſs, and a Sufferer in it) could not but be to him of ſo hard digeſtion, as that though he did but now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of it with me in private (hoping and beleiving that no ſuch meaſure ſhould be offered to him) yet he muſt (if offered) for the Duke his Maſters honour, formalize himſelf againſt it, and give account of it.</p>
                  <p>With theſe words and reaſons I acquainted his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty at <hi>Alderſhot,</hi> and brought him ſuch ſatisfaction with them, as having regard to the Ambaſſadors content, and to the conſequence of his own Order (eſtabliſhed for no more defraying) His Majeſty gave me in charge (with the beſt dexterity that I could apply) to let the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador underſtand his reſolution taken to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                  <p>In obedience hereof, I, the twentieth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:170144:115"/>to <hi>London;</hi> conferred firſt with one Mr. <hi>Wollſin</hi> his Majeſties ſworn Servant (Though imployd here in ſome buſineſſes for the King of <hi>Denmark</hi>) let him know his Majeſties reſolution; no more to defray Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, and intreated him to go before to <hi>Graveſend,</hi> for the more civill conveyance of the Kings pleaſure to that purpoſe, leaſt, if I ſhould directly and in plain termes acquit my ſelf of my charge impoſed, it might have had the relliſh of an Excluſion, or Exception of their perſons from Honours formerly received by other Ambaſſadors. That night taking a barge for my paſſage, I went to them to <hi>Graveſend,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Their names were</hi> Tom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>and</hi> Brah.</note> and only letting them know I had been at Court with the account of their Arrivall, and for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his Majeſties pleaſure about their Reception, (not ſo much as touching the point of their not being defrayed for the reaſon mentioned.) I concluded that I was there by the King my Maſters command to receive, and obey theirs, for aſſiſtance of any of their followers, that they ſhould be pleaſed to imploy to take up their Lodgings, and to perform other Services for their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation. So without other anſwer, queſtion, or exception from them that might bewray diſtaſt from ſuch Innovation, I took leave and returned to <hi>London,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Wollfin,</hi> I, and a Servant of the Ambaſſadors conferring with one <hi>Paul Foure</hi> (an entertainer of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and dwelling in <hi>Lumhard</hi> Street) at what rate he would provide them their Dyet, and Lodging, he (with a Mechanick conſideration of the plunge they were like to be put to (being diſappointed of their firſt expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be defrayed) made unreaſonable demands, as of twelve pounds for eight Maſters, and ſix Servants <hi>per diem,</hi> till ſending to <hi>Graveſend</hi> to the Ambaſſadors for their reſolution, they agreed for —ſix pounds <hi>per diem.</hi> So after the preparation of the Kings and two other Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges (leaving a Light-horſman to be taken up for their Baggage at <hi>Graveſend</hi>) and of the Kings Coach with the Venetians, the States Ambaſſadors, and three Lords Coaches to attend their landing at <hi>Tower wharfe,</hi> I travelled a whole day up and down in <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi> to finde a Lord fitting for their conduct from

                  <p>The twenty fourth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> theſe Ambaſſadors much preſſing their Audience of his Majeſty, I ſent my Oſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer about it to the Court then at <hi>Alderſhot,</hi> and had for anſwer, That wheras the Ambaſſador of the Duke of <hi>Mantova</hi> deſired to have his parting Audience, as ſoon as might be (though it were, he ſaid, in anſwer of the Kings objection, of the unfitneſs of the place he then was in) under a Tree, which ſhould be to him, he ſaid; a Palace, and he eſteemed himſelf as a Prince by ſuch a favour) His Majeſty reſolved, they ſhould have their Audiences both in one day the Tueſday following as <hi>Oatelands,</hi> where there ſhould be a Dinner provided for them, and two Noblemen (with two of the Kings Coaches) for their ſeverall conditions.</p>
                  <p>To this purpoſe I having a Blanck Letter ſent me from my Lord Chamberlain to ſuperſcribe and preſent whatſoever Noble-man I ſhould think fitting for the company of the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and being left to my adventure, without a Letter for the choice of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to accompany the <hi>Montavan,</hi> I ſubſcribed my blanck Letter to the Earle of <hi>Murray</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his aſſent, and prevailed ſo by intreaty with the Lord <hi>Morley,</hi> as our Journey was appointed for the day, when two daies before came to me a Letter from my
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:170144:116"/>Lord Chamberlain, intimating, That wheras the Queen was to come to <hi>Oatlands</hi> at the time aſſigned for the Ambaſſadors Audience there, and that therefore the king would not alter his determined remove from <hi>Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot</hi> to <hi>Oaking;</hi> That if the Ambaſſadors (particularly thoſe of <hi>Denmark)</hi> ſhould perſiſt in their deſire of a ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Audience (otherwiſe then the king wiſht they ſhould) who would willingly have remitted them till Sunday following, for their more ſolemn Reception at <hi>London)</hi> They muſt not expect an entertainment with a Dinner in a place, where nothing good was to be had, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But ſhould have (all of them together) their Audiences at <hi>Oaking</hi> on Tueſday.</p>
                  <p>In obſervation of which direction I repaired to them, ſalved up all as dexterouſly as I could, and having the kings coach, with the Earl of <hi>Murreys</hi> (and for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion the Earle of <hi>Galloway)</hi> for attendance of thoſe of <hi>Denmark;</hi> And my Lord <hi>Morly</hi> with a coach of the Queens (in place of the Kings) to conduct him of <hi>Mantova,</hi> we altogther (having beſides the ſervice of three hired coaches for the firſt, and two for the latter, all at their own charge) parted from <hi>London</hi> on Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day morning, and were by two after Dinner at <hi>Oaking,</hi> where after a brief Complement paſſed between the Ambaſſadors, that had not till then ſeen one anothers (The <hi>Mantovan</hi> having alwaies kept behind, to let it be ſeen he was of another company, and imployment) and bringing them for their reſt to two ſeverall cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; I firſt introduced thoſe of <hi>Denmark,</hi> whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement diſpatched, Letters delivered, and themſelves reconducted to their chamber, I after brougth in the <hi>Mantovan</hi> for his farewell.</p>
                  <p>This paſſed, and he returned to the place of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I again conducted the other two to a private Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience after their publick, and leaving them with his Majeſty accompanied the <hi>Mantovan</hi> to his coach, and returned to the other, whoſe private Audience finiſhed, we went that night to <hi>Winſore,</hi> the next morning to <hi>Hampton</hi> court, and were that evening (as the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador of <hi>Montava</hi> likewiſe was by another way) at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
                     <pb n="223" facs="tcp:170144:116"/>whether both this and the other were accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Lords their conductors to their ſeverall lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings, with a courſe and trouble to me beyond exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, of bringing two Ambaſſadors at once in one day to their Audiences, ſo far from the ordinary ſtanding court of his Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>The next day, <hi>Auguſt</hi> the twentyninth, when the Ambaſſador of <hi>Mantova,</hi> had before hand (immediatly upon his return) ſollicited, and obtained Aſſignation for a parting Audience of the Queen (then come to <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſet</hi> houſe) at two of the clock after noon, and that I had received the deſires of the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Denmark</hi> to have likewiſe their Audience of her Majeſty with her firſt conveniency: I received from the Earl of <hi>Carliel</hi> her Majeſties pleaſure, That at the ſame hour thoſe of <hi>Denmark</hi> ſhould be admitted, and the <hi>Mantovan</hi> an hour after, and that to this purpoſe, I ſhould repair to the Earl of <hi>Dorſet</hi> for his company with the former, and to the Lord <hi>Morley</hi> for the latter: But this Lord being indiſpoſed, I was driven to my former ſhift of procuring a Nobleman for the Service. The Earl of <hi>Dorſet</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took, and diſcharged his part, fetching the two Danes from their lodgings to <hi>Somerſet</hi> houſe, there entring the court with the Queens coach (their other coaches ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſtreet) and accompanying them in the Councel chamber, till their time of admiſſion to the Queen, and diſmiſſion back, whither his Lordſhip went with them to their lodging. In the mean time only at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending them to the Gate of the court, was arreſted there by the neceſſity of my ſervice, for the introduction of the <hi>Mantovan,</hi> who for want of a Nobleman to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him, was fetch from thence by Sir <hi>Robert Ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> Secretary to the Queen, and in one of her Majeſties coaches brought to court, where after a publick Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence given him in her privy chamber, ſhe gave him a more private one in her withdrawing chamber; and at his leave taking preſented him with a Diamond Ring from her own finger of four hundred pounds value; which giving him exceeding ſatisfaction, was an occaſion ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by me for preparation of his better acceptance of the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:170144:117"/>Kings Preſent to come of a thouſand Ounces of gilt Plate (as if both their Majeſties had underſtood one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in the conſent of ſo preſenting him, that the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and ordinary rates preſent might paſs with the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter acceptation, &amp; more out of danger to become a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident for the Kings greater charge hereafter. But while I was thus provident for my Maſters honour and profit, a Meſſage was brought me from my Lord Chamberlain then at Court, intimating, that wheras his Majeſty was pleaſed (by likelyhood from the Queens perſwaſion to correſpond with her in the quality of their gifts) That this Ambaſſadors preſent ſhould have conſiſted of Plate) He was now reſolved to convert it to a Jewell, and to add to the value proportioned, as above: And that to this purpoſe I ſhould reſpite the preſenting of the other, till I ſhould underſtand further from his Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>This I did accordingly, and the day after the Kings arrivall at <hi>London,</hi> I received from the hand of the Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> (the Lord Chamberlain being then going out of Town) and leaving with me ſuch order) a Jewel being a Picture-caſe, ſet with four Diamonds of about five hundred pounds value, but no Picture in it, for which his Majeſties complement was for my delivery; That his Picture wanting there (becauſe one could not be ſo ſuddainly provided and fitted to it) it might be ſupplyed with that which the Ambaſſadors would, he ſaid, preſerve of him in his memory.</p>
                  <p>About the ſame time one of his Gentlemen (whom he had made now and then uſe of for his Pen, and had withall carried the Title, and ſometime executed the Office of Steward) having heard of our cuſtome here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, to preſent Ambaſſadors Secretaries with Chains at their parting, expected the like, and made one Sir <hi>Francis Biondi</hi> his means to me by his Letter to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, whom I anſwered by Letter with reaſons as before; when <hi>Bethleem Gabors</hi> Secretary petended to the like favour from his Majeſty, but was refuſed it, and ſo was this (I having firſt acquainted the Ambaſſador himſelf with his pretence, and with our courſe of limitation here for preſenting Secretaries onely when they were as the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:170144:117"/>Venetians Secretaries, of the Embaſſage, or had been for ſome eſpeciall affaires imployed, and noted for Aſſiduall Negotiators.</p>
                  <p>The fifth of <hi>September,</hi> this Ambaſſador parting hence in the Kings Barge with no more Barges or Boates (that one being capable of his Traine) I accompanied him to Graveſend, where preſenting me with ſixty double Piſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oles, I left him in his way to Dover for his imbarking &amp;c. He was not viſited during the time of his ſtay here by the Venetian Ambaſſador, no more then this by him.</p>
                  <p>The two Moores Commiſſioners from Saly (having long attended the Kings returne to London, and found little fruit of their Negotiation with the Lords) deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and had at laſt an Audience of his Majeſty in the Privy-gallery, comming to Court from their Lodging at Sir <hi>Abraham Williams</hi> in Weſtminſter in a coach of their own hyring without my conduction, onely I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them at the Court Gates, brought them to the Councell-chamber, thence to their Audience, back to their coach, and there left them.</p>
                  <p>The ninth of <hi>December,</hi> the Ambaſſadors of Denmark went to an Audience of his Majeſty at Havering with the Kings coach, and two others hyred by themſelves (onely my ſelfe, and no Nobleman accompanying them (their Audience being to be private.) Arriving there to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Noone, we found a Table covered for their din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at the Kings charge, whereto they ſate down, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly after the King was ſet to his, and were ſerved by the Guard, for whom at their parting they gave to the hand of a Gentleman Uſher Quarter-waiter, 10 pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. After dinner they had their Audience in the Privy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, and that night returned to London. They were at their Dinner accompanied by the Earle of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Sir <hi>John North</hi> and others; the upper end of the Table being found too narrow for both their ſeats, they ſate in chaires at the two ſides, oppoſite one to the other, the preceding Ambaſſador taking his place with the end
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:170144:118"/>of the Table on his left hand, as the firſt place in his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion. Theſe two Ambaſſadors (having another pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Audience aſſigned them at Hampton Court) were pleaſed upon my requeſt to them by Letter to pardon my repaire to their Lodging in London, thence to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company them (as I ought to have done) in the Kings coach, and take me in their way at my Houſe in Twit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenham, where (returning) they left me, after I had entertained them with a collation &amp;c. to their ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
                  <p>Two dayes after, they ſent my Officer for demand of an Audience to take their leaves, which they had gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them for Sunday following, and were brought to it from London by the Earle of Cleaveland and foure or five Gentlemen of the Privy-chamber, (having provided for them a dinner at the Kings charge (this being their laſt Audience) as they ſhould have had at the firſt (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the ſtile then obſerved) but omitted towards them, as alſo to the Mantovan Ambaſſador for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption mentioned before.</p>
                  <p>This courſe of their entertainment at a Dinner, I propounded to his Majeſty in time of his Supper, two nights before by direction from my Lord Chamberlaine, intimating the fitneſſe of it (they having the like at Havering in ſtead of that they ſhould have had at their firſt publick Audience, but was excuſed for the reaſons as before) and had from the King this formall anſwer O yes, yes, let them by any meanes have a Dinner. At the ſame time alſo I propounded (with agreement of the Maſter of the Jewell-Houſe ſtanding by, and by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the Lord Chamberlain) the conſideration of having their Preſents aſſigned beyond the proportion of their Predeceſſours which had been 1500. ounces of gilt Plate, and no more, making our reaſon the regard of their not having been defrayed, as thoſe other had been &amp;c. which his Majeſty approving commanded the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 2000. ounces to be made ready for each of them, being ſoone after brought them by the Maſter of the Jewell-houſe himſelfe, who had from them the gratuity

After Dinner (at which their conductour the Earle of Cleaveland, and the Lord <hi>Gordon,</hi> and others, were gueſts with them) I introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them to their Audience (by the proper way being publick) through the Great Hall, and Guard-chamber to the preſence, thence to the Queene in her Privy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, whither my Lord of Cleaveland made at the firſt ſome ſcruple to accompany them, till my Lord Chamberlain had reſolved him of the fitneſſe, and cuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ome of it, but would by no mens returne with them (as both he (by cuſtome) and the Gentlemen with him ſhould have done) to London whither I onely ſerved them with my Attendance, the reſt taking their leaves at the Ambaſſadors taking coach.</p>
                  <p>The eleventh of <hi>October,</hi> (while neither their Letters nor preſent, nor 1000 <hi>l.</hi> which they were to receive by way of defalcation (from the great debt due to the King their Maſter from ours) were ready for them) they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted me to procure them a private Audience (if this might not (they ſaid) appear a Solcciſme after they had had a publick one for their leave taking) which I did, bringing them to it by the way of the Titlt-yard, and Privy-Galleries to his Majeſties Withdrawing-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Neere the time of theſe Ambaſſadors departure,
<note place="margin">Animo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertendi.</note> my Lord Chamberlain let me know, that having received news of the comming of the Abbot <hi>de la Seaglia</hi> (Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador from the Duke of Savoy) he had written a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (but not yet ſent it) to my Lord Major for proviſion of a Houſe for him in the Citty, to be paid for by the Ambaſſador, but, after I had intimated to his Lordſhip that the courſe had been to receive a ſignification firſt from the Ambaſſador himſelfe of his Arrivall, and of the number of his traine, and accordingly to provide for him; that if his Houſe ſhould be taken up before ſuch ſignification were given, and that he ſhould not come
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:170144:119"/>in a moneth or more after, the charge of it for that time muſt (in reaſon) reſt upon his Majeſty, the Houſe being not taken by his own order, and he being to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray himſelfe for all (as was intended) the letter was ſtayed, and the proviſion of the Houſe for that time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpited. After it was aſſured by ſome paſſengers in the ſame Ship with this Ambaſſador that he was landed, and come onward his way as far as Rocheſter, I repaired to my Lord Chamberlain for order of his reception how, and where &amp;c. went with his Lordſhip to the King about it, and received from his Majeſty this formall ſignification, that anſwerable to the order eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, and already practiſed towards the King of Frances Ambaſſador (Monſieur <hi>de Baſſampierre)</hi> the the Duke of <hi>Mantovas,</hi> and the King of Denmarks, and particularly towards the laſt, his Unckles) he would not defray him, nor any other, except at concluſion of Peace Marriages, Baptiſmes of his Children, and ſuch like Extraordinary occaſions. Upon further diſcourſe that then paſſed, where, and how he ſhould be received, it was concluded by his Majeſty not onely for the preſent but for the future, that neither he, nor any other Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador under a Kings, ſhould be met, or received fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off, then at Tower-Wharffe in the Kings coach, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had been brought thither from Graveſend by the Maſter of the Ceremonies, and that if he were a Kings Ambaſſador (the Maſter of the Ceremonies meeting him no further off, then at Graveſend (unleſſe his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming for the before excepted purpoſes might by order carry him further) he ſhould be received no neerer Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, then at Greenwich by a Nobleman out of the Barge that brought him from Graveſend into the Kings Barge, and thence by him accompanied to his landing at Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-wharffe, and thence in the Kings coach to his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>The day after that this Order was eſtabliſhed (or rather revived) no certaine notice being yet given, or taken concerning the Savoy Ambaſſador for preparation of his Houſe, becauſe no follower of his was come im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:170144:119"/>about it) Mr. <hi>Gerbiere</hi> (a Gentleman ſerving the Duke of <hi>Buckingham)</hi> who had paſſed the Seas in his company, and had received ſome particular directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that purpoſe) went with me to my Lord Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain, and acquainted him with the Ambaſſadors in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions and deſires (as of one that agreed not well, he ſaid, with Journies by water, and had brought with him a Coach and Horſes of his own) to come by land: But this deſire and deſign of his was ſoon diverted by his Lordſhip, after he had pointed at the incommodity of a Noblemans meeting him with the Kings Coach, at the end of <hi>Southwark</hi> (where was no houſe nor place proper for his, and his companies ſtay, til the inſtant of the Ambaſſadors coming thither) and what he ſhould want in that part of honour of having ſent to him from the King to <hi>Graveſend,</hi> the Maſter of the Ceremonies (with his Majeſties Barge for his tranſport) who if he ſhould come by land, could not with that proviſion (and muſt not with Coaches, becauſe of their late reſtraint of imployment for ſervice of Ambaſſadors at the Kings charge) attend him.</p>
                  <p>It was further intimated, that if he ſhould not think fit to make contiunall uſe of the Italian <hi>Jeronimo's</hi> houſe for his lodging (which he had already hired) he ſhould have another hired for him for his better accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at a rate reaſonabe (to be paid by himſelf.) Theſe Allegations and Reaſons taken notice of by Mr. <hi>Gerbiere,</hi> were conveyed to the knowledge of the Ambaſſador at <hi>Graveſend,</hi> and his approbation being returned, the next day I went early with the Kings Barge, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to bring him to Tower-wharff, where by the Lord <hi>North</hi> with half a dozen Gentlemen, the Kings Coach, and ſeven other attending him, he was conducted to h is lodging, <hi>October</hi> 19.

And about foure of the clock (attending ſo long the Queens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne from Veſpers, of whom (having been formerly known to her) he had a ſight and <hi>Bay-ſamaine</hi> in <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitu,</hi> as ſhe went to her coach through the Privy-Gallery) had his Audience in the Preſence, returned to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel-chamber til the Queen and her Ladies were in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to receive him, and having had a gracious Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of her Majeſty, with the ſame company and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance that he came, returned to his Lodging.</p>
                  <p>The Tueſday following, though he had let fall (of purpoſe it ſeemed for his after freedome, ſome ſpeeches tending to the liberty which his Majeſty (he ſaid) to me) had given him once for all to have acceſſe to his Preſence without Ceremony) my Lord of Carliel tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling me (and deſiring me to let him know) his Majeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies Pleaſure to give him a private Audience that After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, I intreated his Lordſhip as far forth as he could, he would direct that domeſtique privacy, as diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the reſpects due to his Majeſty, and the right of my charge in the duty of my attendances for thoſe Services. Which his Lordſhip rightly underſtanding, tooke on him to regulate by remonſtrating to the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador (as he did) how much he ſhould derogate from the regard proper to his own quality (beſides what might be challenged due to mine) by the worlds taking notice, and the diſcourſes of the cauſes why I did not attend him at his Audiences) and by perſwading him, that howſoever he might have his private acceſſes at his

                  <p>On the way to <hi>Graveſend,</hi> I fell in diſcourſe (pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely) with Monſieur <hi>Tompſon,</hi> concerning their not viſiting the Duke of <hi>Savoys</hi> Ambaſſador, and found by his Ejaculations, that they repented them of their pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillioes, profeſſing to me; That if they had at firſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that the King (and ſince the Duke, who had made a viſit to them five or ſix daies before their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, on no other errand then touching that viſit) would have taken ſuch notice of it, they would have diſpenſed with their own reaſons for want of examples, and have made a viſit to him; but as that now (ſo were their
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:170144:124"/>departure) would have been unſeaſonable, ſo they had left it to the hazard of whatſoever inconvenience might follow. I replyed, they might have diſcovered by my diligent endeavours, the affection of his Majeſty to have had that Complement performed, as requiſite for entertainment of the correſpondence between their King and that Prince, and others, in times that needed it, but that having no formall command from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to meddle in it, I had reaſon to be ſo reſerved as I had been. At laſt, I preſſed him to acquaint me with the truth of what was held, I ſaid, at Court, that the Venetian had been the firſt moving cauſe of their not diſcharging that viſit with the reaſons mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>But Monſieur <hi>Tompſon</hi> proteſted to me, that he was charged wrongfully, having been rather, he ſaid, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwader of them by Sir <hi>Francis Biondi</hi> (ſent to them by the Venetian to that purpoſe, with aſſurance that they beginning the Complement, he would not fail to ſecond them) then that he had ever uſed one word to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them.</p>
                  <p>With this acknowledgment I after acquainted the Savoy Ambaſſador, and had for anſwer; That it was now too late for them to amend the faults they had made, he having (he ſaid) given account of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings to the Duke his Maſter, and was for himſelf, he ſaid, reſolved, that if they ſhould make a return, as they intended, to <hi>England,</hi> he would never, he ſaid, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any viſit from them, though they ſhould (with acknowledgment of their error) make offer of it.</p>

                  <p>The next Puntillio obtruded was, whether at the day of their Audience, they ſhould dine in Court as ſome other Ambaſſadors (particularly the Savoyard) had done lately before. To remove this rub I wrote to my Lord Chamberlains Secretary a Letter for his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips ſight, and conſideration, imparting that the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer before in the progreſs time, the <hi>Mantovan</hi> and the two Daniſh Ambaſſadors had dined in Court (the firſt at his firſt Audience at Windſor,
<note place="margin">Whereof ſee the reaſon as alſo why the Mantovan dined not in Court at his firſt Audience.</note> the latter at Havering at their ſecond private Audience) and that ſince that the King comming to White-Hall, though the Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of dineing in Court were not perhaps neceſſary, nor fit to be made to any Ambaſſador (as out of an eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed courſe) at or in the Kings ſtanding Houſe) it having been made elſewhere with regard of inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency, or want of place fitting with their owne provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to give themſelves a dinner at or neere the Court in time of progreſs) his Majeſty was yet pleaſed to comply with them in that point, but not to ſerve for an example to others.</p>
                  <p>But now there muſt a ſtep be made backward to the yeare 1624. at which time there happend a noble tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe reflecting on the two Spaniſh Ambaſſadors <hi>viz.</hi> the Marqueſſe <hi>de Inojoſa,</hi> and <hi>Don Carles Columa</hi> then Reſident here, the laſt of a good diſpoſition, the other ſower and harſh, ſo that they were compard to oil and vinegar; the buſineſſe was thus; the Prince of Wales being back from Madrid, matters began to gather ill blood twixt England and Spain; for the Treaty both of the match and Palatinate were diſſolved by Act of Parliament, and the Duke of Buckingham made uſe of Parliament, and Puritan (who ſwayed then moſt in the Houſes) to compaſſe this worke. The Spaniſh Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors underſtanding that the rupture of the matrimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all treaty proceeded from the Practices of Buckingham, they deviſed a way how to ſupplant, and ruine him;
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:170144:127"/>they fell into conſideration that King <hi>James</hi> was grown old, wherefore the leaſt thing might raiſe umbrages of diſtruſt and feare in him, therefore by a notable way of plotting, they informed him at a private Audience that there was a dangerous deſigne againſt his Royall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority traced by the Duke of Buckingham and his confederats, the manner of which conſpiracy will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in this following Memoriall or Remonſtrance of Sir <hi>Walter Aſhton</hi> left ſtill Ambaſſador leger in the Court of Spaine, which he preſented there to the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, which was thus.</p>

                           <hi>He received another anſwer from your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, wherin he found leſſe grounds to work upon, and having underſtood that neither by the</hi> Padre Marſto, <hi>or your Majeſties Ambaſſadors who have aſſiſted, theſe daies paſſed in his Court there was ſomething to be further propounded and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red touching the buſineſſe of the Palatinat, wherby he might receive contentment: The ſaid Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors to this day have not ſaid any thing at all to any purpoſe, which being compared with other circumſtances of their ill carriage, he gathers and doubts that according to their ill affections and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:170144:127"/>intentions wherwith they have proceeded in all things, but ſpecially in one particular, they have laboured to hinder the good correspondence with the ſo neceſſary and deſired intelligence which ſhould be conſerv'd with your Majeſty.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Moreover he ſaith, the King his Maſter hath commanded him to give an account to your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, that in an Audience which he gave to the Marqueſſe of</hi> Inojoſa, <hi>and to</hi> Don Carlos Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, <hi>they under the cloak and pretext of zeal, and particular care of his Majeſties perſon, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to diſcover unto him a very great Conjuration both againſt his Royall Dignity and perſon. Which was, that at the beginning of this Parliament the Duke of</hi> Buckingham <hi>had conſulted with certain Lords and others of the Arguments and means which were to be taken for the breaking and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving of the Treaties both of Match and Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinat, and their Conſultations paſſed ſo far, that if his Majeſty would not conform himſelf to their Councels, they would give him a houſe of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, whither he might retire himſelf to his ſport, in regard that the Prince had now years ſufficient and parts anſwerable for the Government of the Kingdome: The Information was of that quality, that it was ſufficient to make impreſsions in him of an everlaſting jealouſie, in regard that through the ſides of</hi> Buckingham <hi>they wounded the Prince his Son with the Nobility, it being not probable that they could effect ſuch a deſign without depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting totally from that Obligation of faith and loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty which they owed to his perſon and Crown, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the intereſſed Lords made themſelves culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:170144:128"/>as Concealors: Nor is it likely the Duke would hurt himſelf upon ſuch an enterprize, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out communicating it firſt to the Prince, and knowledge of his pleaſure.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But becauſe the Information might be made more cleer, his Majeſty did make many inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the ſaid Ambaſſadors, that they would give the Authors of the ſaid Conſpiracy, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſole means wherby their own honour might be preſerved, and wherby the great care and zeal they pretended to have of his perſon might appear: But the ſaid Ambaſſadors inſtead of confirming the great zeal they made profesſion to bear him, all the anſwer they gave conſiſted of Arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the diſcovery of the Conspirators, ſo that for confirmation of the ſaid Report, there remain'd no other means then the examination of ſome of his Councell of State, and principall Subjects, which was put in execution accordingly, cauſing them to be put to their Oathes in his own preſence, and commanding that ſuch Interrogations and queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhould be propounded unto them that were moſt pertinent to the accuſation, ſo that not the least part, particle, or circumſtance remain'd which was not exactly examined, and canvaſ'd: And he found in the Duke and the reſt who were exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, a moſt clear and ſincere innocency touching the impeachments and imputations wherewith your Majeſties Ambaſſadors had charged them.</hi>

                           <hi>This being done, he returned to make new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances unto the ſaid Ambaſſadors, that they would not prefer the diſcovery of the names of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:170144:128"/>to the ſecurity of his Royall perſon, to the truth and honour of themſelves, and to the hazzard of an opinion to be held the Authors and betrayers of a plot of ſo much malice, ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and danger; but the ſayd Ambaſſadors continued ſtill in a knotty kind of obſtinacy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to conceale the names of the Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, notwithſtanding that he gave them Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience afterwards, wherein the Marquis of</hi> Ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joſa <hi>took his leave.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But a few dayes after, they deſired new Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, pretending they had ſomething to ſay that concerned the publick good, and conduced to the entire reſtitution of the Palatinate, and thereby to the conſervation and confirmation of the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with your Majeſty: But having ſuspended ſome few dayes to give them Audience, thinking that being thereby better adviſed, they would think on better courſes, and diſcover the Authors of ſo pernicious a Plot, and having ſince made many inſtances to that effect, and attended the ſucceſſe of ſo long patience, he ſent his Secretary Sir</hi> Edward Conway, <hi>and Sir</hi> Francis Coting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton <hi>Secretary to the Prince, commanding them that they ſhould ſignifie unto the ſayd Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, that he deſired nothing more then a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of the freindſhip betwixt the two Crowns, therefore if they had any thing to ſay, they ſhould communicate it unto the ſayd Secretaries, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of great truſt, which he imployed therefore expreſly to that end, and if they made any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of this alſo, then they might chooſe amongſt his Councill of State thoſe whom they liked best,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:170144:129"/>and he would command that they ſhould preſently repaire unto them; and if this alſo ſhould ſeeme inconvenient, they might ſend him what they had to ſay in a Letter by whom they thought fitteſt, and he would receive it with his own hands.</hi>

                           <hi>In conformity to what hath been ſayd, the ſayd Ambaſſador of the King of Great Brittaine ſaith, That the King his Maſter hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to demand refaction and ſatisfaction of your Majeſty againſt the ſayd Marquis de</hi> Ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joſa, <hi>and</hi> Don Carlos Coloma, <hi>making your Majeſty the Judge of the great ſcandall, and enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous offence which they have committed againſt him, and againſt publick right, expecting ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice from your Majeſty in the demonſtrations, and chaſtiſement that your Majeſty ſhall inflict
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:170144:129"/>upon them; which, in regard of the manner of proceeding with your Majeſty, and out of your Majeſties owne integrity and goodneſſe ought to be expected.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Furthermore, the ſayd Ambaſſador ſaith That the King his Maſter hath commanded him to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure your Majeſty, that hitherto he hath not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingled the correſpondence and friendſhip hee holds with your Majeſty, with the faults and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences of your Miniſters, but leaves them and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraines them to their owne perſons, and that he ſtill perſeveres with your Majeſty in the true and ancient freindſhip and brotherhood, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, to which purpoſe hee is ready to give a hearing to any thing that ſhall be reaſonable, and give anſwer thereunto, therefore when it ſhall pleaſe your Majeſty to imploy any Ambaſſador thither, he will afford them all good entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and receive them with that love which is fitting.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>For concluſion the ſayd Ambaſſador humbly beſeecheth your Majeſty that you would be pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to obſerve and weigh well the care and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe wherewith the King his Maſter hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded towards your Majeſties Ambaſſadors, not obliging them to any precipitate reſolutions, but allowing them time enough to prove, and give light of that which they had spoken: And beſides by opening them many wayes beſides, whereby they might have complyed with their Orders, if they had any ſuch, which courſe if they had taken, they might well have given ſatisfaction to the King his Maſter, and moderated the ſo grounded opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:170144:130"/>of their ill proceedings againſt the Peace, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the good intelligence and correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence 'twixt the two Crownes.</hi>

                  </floatingText>
                  <p>Such was the complaint, or charge rather which was exhibited by our Ambaſſador in <hi>Spain,</hi> againſt <hi>Inojoſa</hi> and <hi>Coloma</hi> (for their miſdemeanours in <hi>England</hi>) which fill'd that Court full of dark whiſpers for the preſent, and the World expected that the ſaid Ambaſſadors ſhould receive ſome puniſhment, or at leaſt ſome mark of diſgrace at their return; but matters growing daily worſe and worſe betwixt the two Crownes, they were rather rewarded then reprehended, <hi>Inojoſa</hi> being promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> and <hi>Coloma</hi> received ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of employment and honours in <hi>Flanders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Civilities of <hi>England</hi> at that time towards the ſaid Ambaſſadors was much cryed up abroad, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſo pernicious and machinations to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſe the whole Engliſh Court, and demolish <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham,</hi> yet were they permitted to depart peaceably, and though they had no Kings Ship to tranſport, them, yet Sir <hi>Lewis Leukner</hi> was ſent to conduct them to the Sea ſide, for prevention of any affront, or outrage that might have been offered them.</p>
